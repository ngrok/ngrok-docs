title: What is ngrok?
description: ngrok is a globally distributed reverse proxy that secures, protects, and accelerates your applications and network services.

You can think of ngrok as the front door to your applications.

ngrok is _environment independent_ because it can deliver traffic to services running anywhere with no changes to your environment's networking.
Run your app on AWS, Azure, Heroku, an on-premise Kubernetes cluster, a Raspberry Pi, and even your laptop.
With ngrok, it all works the same.

ngrok is a _unified ingress platform_ because it combines all the components to deliver traffic from your services to the internet into one. ngrok consolidates together your reverse proxy, load balancer, API gateway, firewall, delivery network, DDoS protection and more.

## What can you do with ngrok?

### Production Ingress

- **API Gateway**: Use ngrok's [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/actions/) to secure, protect,
  accelerate and transform traffic to your production APIs.
- **Kubernetes Ingress**: Run the [ngrok Kubernetes Operator](/k8s/) to create ingress
  to Kubernetes services running in any cluster.
- **Identity-Aware Proxy**: Use ngrok's [OAuth](/traffic-policy/actions/oauth/),
  [JWT Validation](/traffic-policy/actions/jwt-validation/), or [OpenID Connect](/traffic-policy/actions/oidc/) actions to federate your app's authentication to an identity provider.
- **Load Balancer**: Use [Endpoint
  Pools](/universal-gateway/endpoint-pooling/) to load-balance traffic for scalability, failover, or to do blue/green and canary deployments.

### Ingress to external networks

- **APIs in customer networks**: Run the lightweight [ngrok agent](/agent/) or
  [Kubernetes Operator](/k8s/) in your customers' environments to securely connect to APIs in their networks without complex network configuration.
- **APIs on devices**: Run [ngrok as a service](/agent/#running-ngrok-in-the-background) on
  your devices to create secure URLs for their local APIs enabling your cloud service to control and administrate them.
- **APIs in local dev environments**: Import [ngrok as a library](/agent-sdks)
  into your own CLI so you can create better local dev experiences for your developer customers.

### Development and testing

- **Webhook Testing**: Run ngrok on your local machine to get a URL to receive
  webhooks directly in the app you're developing. [Inspect and replay requests](/agent/web-inspection-interface/) for fast development.
- **Local Previews**: Demo a website running on your local machine to a client
  or stakeholder without deploying to a staging site.
- **Mobile Backend Testing**: Test your mobile apps against a backend that
  you're developing on your local machine.

### Remote access

- **SSH**: Create [TCP endpoints](/universal-gateway/tcp/) to enable SSH access to remote machines.
- **RDP**: Create [TCP endpoints](/universal-gateway/tcp/) to enable RDP access to remote machines.
