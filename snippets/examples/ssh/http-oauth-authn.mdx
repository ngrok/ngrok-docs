When creating a reverse tunnel, you must provide a publicly accessible URL to your traffic policy file, as shown in this example.

Create the `oauth-policy.yml` file:

```yaml
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: oauth
        config:
          provider: google
```

Store this file at a publicly accessible address online.

Add it with the `--traffic-policy-url` flag.

```bash
ssh -R 443:localhost:80 v2@connect.ngrok-agent.com http --traffic-policy-url=https://some-website/oauth-policy.yml
```
