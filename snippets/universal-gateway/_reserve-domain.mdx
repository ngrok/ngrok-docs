Navigate to the [**Domains** section](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains) of the ngrok dashboard and click **New +** to reserve a free static domain like `https://your-service.ngrok.app` or a [custom domain](/universal-gateway/custom-domains/) you already own.

We'll refer to this domain as `$NGROK_DOMAIN` from here on out.
