Endpoints have one of four supported **protocols**:

- [HTTP/S Endpoints](/universal-gateway/http) - `http`, `https`
- [TCP Endpoints](/universal-gateway/tcp) - `tcp`
- [TLS Endpoints](/universal-gateway/tls) - `tls`

An Endpoint's protocol is specified in the scheme of its URL. For example:

- `https://app.example.com` uses the `https` protocol
- `tcp://db.internal:3306` uses the `tcp` protocol

An Endpoint's protocol determines:

1. How it processes connections that it receives
1. The phases, variables, and actions that may be defined on its [Traffic
   Policy](/traffic-policy).
1. What hostnames and ports may be specified in its URL
