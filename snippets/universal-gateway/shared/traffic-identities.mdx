ngrok's [Traffic Identities](/traffic-policy/identities/) feature can be used to observe all of the authenticated user activity across your account in the ngrok dashboard or via API.
Whenever a user authenticates or accesses an endpoint with a configured OIDC action, their Traffic Identity record is created or updated.

You may also use Traffic Identities to remotely log a user out by [revoking a session](/traffic-policy/identities/#revoke-sessions).
