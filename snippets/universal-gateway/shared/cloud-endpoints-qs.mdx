[Cloud endpoints](/universal-gateway/cloud-endpoints/) are persistent and live until they are
deleted.
They are created via [the
ngrok Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/endpoints/new) or [API](/api/). [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/) controls how a Cloud Endpoint

See the [Cloud Endpoints Quickstart](/getting-started/cloud-endpoints-quickstart/) for a step-by-step guide on how to create a Cloud Endpoint in the ngrok Dashboard.

The following example uses the API to create a Cloud Endpoint which returns a `Hello world!` 200 OK response.
