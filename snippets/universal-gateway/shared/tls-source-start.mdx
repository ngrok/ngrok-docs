TLS endpoints enable you to deliver any network service that runs over a TLS-based protocol. 
TLS endpoints make no assumptions about the wrapped protocol being transported.

TLS endpoints inspect the [Server Name Indication (SNI)](#sni)
data on incoming TLS connections to route connections to the appropriate
endpoint.

Because the TLS protocol describes no application-level semantics, ngrok can
only offer a [limited set of Traffic Policy actions](/traffic-policy/actions/)
to handle TLS traffic.

If you are delivering an HTTPS application, prefer to create an [HTTP
Endpoint](/universal-gateway/http/).
