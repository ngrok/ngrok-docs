HTTP/S endpoints enable you to serve web services like REST APIs, web applications, websites, and WebSocket servers. 
Serving a web application is as simple as `ngrok http 80`.

Once your endpoint is running, check out:

- [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/) - Add routing, authentication and traffic transformation
- [Traffic Inspector](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/traffic-inspection/) - Real-time observability with request/response introspection
- [Endpoint Pooling](/universal-gateway/endpoint-pooling/) - Load balancing
