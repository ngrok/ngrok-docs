If you don't already have an app to try out, try out this sample manifest, which installs our [TinyLlama image](https://github.com/ngrok-samples/tinyllama) onto your cluster.
Save the YAML below into a file named `deployment.yaml`.

If you already have a deployment, you can skip this step, but you'll need to adapt the Operator configuration and test requests.

```yaml title="deployment.yaml"
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: tinyllama
  namespace: default
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: tinyllama
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: tinyllama
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: tinyllama
          image: ghcr.io/ngrok-samples/tinyllama:main
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: "1"
              memory: "2Gi"
            limits:
              cpu: "2"
              memory: "3Gi"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: tinyllama
  namespace: default
spec:
  selector:
    app: tinyllama
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
  type: ClusterIP
```

Add the deployment and service to your cluster with `kubectl`.

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```
