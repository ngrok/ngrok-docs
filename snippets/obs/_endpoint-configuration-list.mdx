Your IdP may provide this to you as a a file to download or as a URL. | | endpoint_configurations.saml.force_authn | boolean | If true, indicates that whenever we redirect a user to the IdP for authentication that the IdP must prompt the user for authentication credentials even if the user already has a valid session with the IdP. | | endpoint_configurations.saml.allow_idp_initiated | boolean | If true, the IdP may initiate a login directly (e.g. the user does not need to visit the endpoint first and then be redirected).
The IdP should set the `RelayState` parameter to the target URL of the resource they want the user to be redirected to after the SAML login assertion has been processed. | | endpoint_configurations.saml.authorized_groups | List&lt;string&gt; | If present, only users who are a member of one of the listed groups may access the target endpoint. | | endpoint_configurations.saml.entity_id | string | The SP Entity's unique ID.
This always takes the form of a URL.
In ngrok's implementation, this URL is the same as the metadata URL.
This will need to be specified to the IdP as configuration. | | endpoint_configurations.saml.assertion_consumer_service_url | string | The public URL of the SP's Assertion Consumer Service.
This is where the IdP will redirect to during an authentication flow.
This will need to be specified to the IdP as configuration. | | endpoint_configurations.saml.single_logout_url | string | The public URL of the SP's Single Logout Service.
This is where the IdP will redirect to during a single logout flow.
This will optionally need to be specified to the IdP as configuration. | | endpoint_configurations.saml.request_signing_certificate_pem | string | PEM-encoded x.509 certificate of the key pair that is used to sign all SAML requests that the ngrok SP makes to the IdP.
Many IdPs do not support request signing verification, but we highly recommend specifying this in the IdP's configuration if it is supported. | | endpoint_configurations.saml.metadata_url | string | A public URL where the SP's metadata is hosted.
If an IdP supports dynamic configuration, this is the URL it can use to retrieve the SP metadata. | | endpoint_configurations.saml.nameid_format | string | Defines the name identifier format the SP expects the IdP to use in its assertions to identify subjects.
If unspecified, a default value of `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent` will be used.

After this period is exceeded, a user must reauthenticate. | | endpoint_configurations.oidc.issuer | string | URL of the OIDC "OpenID provider".
This is the base URL used for discovery. | | endpoint_configurations.oidc.client_id | string | The OIDC app's client ID and OIDC audience. | | endpoint_configurations.oidc.client_secret | string | The OIDC app's client secret. | | endpoint_configurations.oidc.scopes | List&lt;string&gt; | The set of scopes to request from the OIDC identity provider. | | uri | string | URI of the endpoint configurations list API resource | | next_page_uri | string | URI of the next page, or null if there is no next page |
