|---|---|---|
| enabled | boolean | `true` if the module will be applied to traffic, `false` to disable. default `true` if unspecified |
| terminate_at | string | `edge` if the ngrok edge should terminate TLS traffic, `upstream` if TLS traffic should be passed through to the upstream ngrok agent / application server for termination. if `upstream` is chosen, most other modules will be disallowed because they rely on the ngrok edge being able to access the underlying traffic. |
| min_version | string | The minimum TLS version used for termination and advertised to the client during the TLS handshake. if unspecified, ngrok will choose an industry-safe default. This value must be null if `terminate_at` is set to `upstream`. |
