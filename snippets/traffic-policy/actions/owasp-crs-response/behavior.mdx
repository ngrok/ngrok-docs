## Behavior

This action evaluates rules for response headers and body (when `process_body` is enabled), and each matching rule adds to the overall score of a response. If the score exceeds the set score threshold, the action will block the response.

The tallying process is called Anomaly Scoring, and is detailed on [the CRS website.](https://coreruleset.org/docs/2-how-crs-works/2-1-anomaly_scoring/)

### Default Behavior

The default behavior for this action is based on the following [Coraza](https://coraza.io/) directives and rules from v4.14.0 of the CRS:

- [coraza.conf-recommended](https://github.com/corazawaf/coraza/blob/main/coraza.conf-recommended)
- [crs-setup.conf.example](https://github.com/corazawaf/coraza-coreruleset/blob/main/rules/%40crs-setup.conf.example)
- [@owasp_crs/\*.conf](https://github.com/corazawaf/coraza-coreruleset/tree/main/rules/%40owasp_crs)

Included in these rules is an outbound anomaly score threshold of 4 and a [paranoia level](https://coreruleset.org/docs/2-how-crs-works/2-2-paranoia_levels/) of 1.

### Managing Fallback Behavior (`on_error`)

If `on_error` is set to `halt` (default) and the action encounters an error when forwarding traffic, the Traffic Policy chain will halt and no further actions will be executed. For example, if you have a `log` action after the `owasp-crs-response` action, the `log` action will not be run and the error will be returned.

However, if `on_error` is set to `continue`, actions that appear after the `owasp-crs-response` action will still be executed even if the `owasp-crs-response` action encounters an error.

### Body Processing

When `process_body` is enabled, ngrok evaluates rules against the first 4kb of the body. If the body is larger than 4kb, we ignore the portion after the first 4kb.

### Rule Exclusion

When `exclude_rule_ids` is configured, ngrok skips evaluation of the specified rule IDs. This allows you to disable specific OWASP CRS rules that may be causing false positives in your environment.

### Outbound Anomaly Score Threshold Exceeded

If the anomaly score accumulated from matching rules exceeds the threshold, ngrok blocks the request with a `HTTP 403` response. The response from your upstream does not make it to the client.

### Failure to process the body successfully

If ngrok is unable to read the response body successfully, ngrok blocks the response with a `HTTP 500` response. The response from your upstream does not make it to the client.
