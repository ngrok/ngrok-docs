### Removing headers from all requests

We have been getting a lot of requests with `x-client-version` and `x-trace-id`
and it is starting to overwhelm our logging system. We want to remove these headers
from all requests. The following example demonstrates how to remove these headers
using the `remove-headers` action.

#### Example Traffic Policy Document

<CodeGroup>
```yaml policy.yml {4-8}
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: remove-headers
        config:
          headers:
            - x-client-version
            - x-trace-id
```

```json policy.json {5-13}
{
	"on_http_request": [
		{
			"actions": [
				{
					"type": "remove-headers",
					"config": {
						"headers": ["x-client-version", "x-trace-id"]
					}
				}
			]
		}
	]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

For this example, we are assuming that ngrok is pointing at the upstream service
https://httpbin.org.

#### Example Request

```bash
$ curl -H "x-client-version: 3.1" -H "x-trace-id: abc123" https://httpbin.ngrok.app/get
< HTTP/2 200

{
...
  "headers": {
    "Date": "2024-06-24T15:30:00Z",
  }
...
}
```

In this example even though we sent the `x-client-version` and `x-trace-id` headers,
they were not present on the request that was sent upstream.
