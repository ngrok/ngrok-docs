### Enabling Mutual TLS

This example demonstrates how to use mutual TLS (mTLS) with this action. mTLS requires both the client and server to present certificates to each other to establish a secure connection. This example will show you how to generate a custom Certificate Authority (CA) and client certificate to use.

#### Generate Certificates

We will create a new CA that will be used to sign the client certificate. This allows you to generate multiple client certificates that are trusted by the CA if needed.

```bash
# 1. Generate CA private key (ca.key)
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out ca.key -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048

# 2. Generate CA certificate (ca.crt)
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key ca.key -sha256 -days 365 -out ca.crt -subj "/CN=ExampleCA"

# 3. Generate client private key (client.key)
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out client.key -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048

# 4. Generate client certificate signing request (CSR) (client.csr)
openssl req -new -key client.key -out client.csr -subj "/CN=ExampleClient"

# 5. Generate client certificate (client.crt)
openssl x509 -req -in client.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out client.crt -days 365 -sha256
```

These commands will result in five new files: `ca.key`, `ca.crt`, `client.key`, `client.csr`, and `client.key`. You will use the contents of `ca.crt` in your traffic policy to validate requests via `curl` which will use `client.key` and `client.crt`.

#### Example Traffic Policy Document

Using the CA certificate generated above, you can specify the `mutual_tls_certificate_authorities` field in the traffic policy to trust the CA that issued the client certificate.

<CodeGroup>
```yaml policy.yml {4-10}
on_tcp_connect:
  - actions:
      - type: terminate-tls
        config:
          mutual_tls_certificate_authorities:
            - |-
              -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
              ... certificate ...
              -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

```json policy.json {5-12}
{
	"on_tcp_connect": [
		{
			"actions": [
				{
					"type": "terminate-tls",
					"config": {
						"mutual_tls_certificate_authorities": [
							"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n... certificate ...\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----"
						]
					}
				}
			]
		}
	]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

You may also optionally [upload the CA certificate](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/tls-cert-authorities) in the ngrok dashboard and use its ID the `mutual_tls_certificate_authorities` array.

#### Start an Endpoint with the Traffic Policy

```bash
ngrok http 8080 --url terminate-tls-example.ngrok.app --traffic-policy-file /path/to/policy.yml
```

#### Make a Request

Now you can make a request to the endpoint with the `--cert` and `--key` flags to specify the client certificate and private key.

```bash
curl --cert client.crt --key client.key https://terminate-tls-example.ngrok.app
```
