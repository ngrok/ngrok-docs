### Minimum and Maximum TLS Versions

This example sets the minimum and maximum TLS versions that the endpoint will support for incoming connections to TLS version 1.3. Clients can then only connect to the endpoint using TLS version 1.3 and will receive a handshake error if they attempt to connect using a different version.

#### Example Traffic Policy Document

<CodeGroup>
```yaml policy.yml {4-7}
on_tcp_connect:
  - actions:
      - type: terminate-tls
        config:
          min_version: '1.3'
          max_version: '1.3'
```

```json policy.json {5-11}
{
	"on_tcp_connect": [
		{
			"actions": [
				{
					"type": "terminate-tls",
					"config": {
						"min_version": "1.3",
						"max_version": "1.3"
					}
				}
			]
		}
	]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

#### Start an Endpoint with the Traffic Policy

```bash
ngrok http 8080 --url https://terminate-tls-example.ngrok.app --traffic-policy-file /path/to/policy.yml
```

#### Make a Request

```bash
curl https://terminate-tls-example.ngrok.app
```

If your curl was built with a version of OpenSSL that supports TLS 1.3, the request will succeed. However, we can verify that the endpoint only supports TLS 1.3 by telling curl to use a different version of TLS:

```bash
curl https://terminate-tls-example.ngrok.app --tlsv1.2 --tls-max 1.2
```

You should receive a "alert protocol version" error indicating that the endpoint only supports TLS 1.3.
