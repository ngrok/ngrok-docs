### Deny all traffic

The following [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/)
configuration will deny all inbound traffic on your endpoint.

#### Example Traffic Policy Document

<CodeGroup>
```yaml policy.yml {4-10}
on_tcp_connect:
  - actions:
      - type: deny
```

```json policy.json {5-7}
{
  "on_tcp_connect": [
    {
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "deny"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
</CodeGroup>

#### Example Request

```bash
$ telnet 5.tcp.ngrok.io 22984

Trying...
Connected to 5.tcp.ngrok.io.
Connection closed by foreign host.
```

In this example, we attempt to connect to `5.tcp.ngrok.io:22984` using the
`telnet` command and ngrok immediately closes the connection.
