### Deny all traffic

The following [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/)
configuration will deny all inbound traffic on your endpoint.

#### Example Traffic Policy Document

<CodeGroup>
```yaml policy.yml {4-10}
on_tcp_connect:
  - actions:
      - type: deny
```

```json policy.json {5-7}
{
	"on_tcp_connect": [
		{
			"actions": [
				{
					"type": "deny"
				}
			]
		}
	]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

#### Example Request

```bash
$ telnet 5.tcp.ngrok.io 22984

Trying...
Connected to 5.tcp.ngrok.io.
Connection closed by foreign host.
```

In this example, we attempt to connect to `5.tcp.ngrok.io:22984` using the
`telnet` command and ngrok immediately closes the connection.
