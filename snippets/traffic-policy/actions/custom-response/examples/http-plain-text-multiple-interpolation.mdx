### Custom Plaintext Response with Multiple CEL Interpolations

The following [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/)
configuration demonstrates how to use the `custom-response` action to return a
`text/plain` response with multiple CEL interpolations.

#### Example Traffic Policy Document

<CodeGroup>
```yaml policy.yml {6-12}
on_http_request:
  - expressions:
      - req.url.path == '/api/example'
    actions:
      - type: custom-response
        config:
          status_code: 418
          body: connection began at ${conn.ts.start}, now ${timestamp(time.now)}
          headers:
            content-type: text/plain
```

```json policy.json {8-17}
{
	"on_http_request": [
		{
			"expressions": ["req.url.path == '/api/example'"],
			"actions": [
				{
					"type": "custom-response",
					"config": {
						"status_code": 418,
						"body": "connection began at ${conn.ts.start}, now ${timestamp(time.now)}",
						"headers": {
							"content-type": "text/plain"
						}
					}
				}
			]
		}
	]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

#### Example Request

```bash
$ curl https://example.ngrok.app/api/example
```

```http
HTTP/2 418 I'm a teapot
content-type: text/plain

connection began at 2024-06-24T15:30:00Z, now 2024-06-24T16:30:00Z
```

In this example, when a request is made to `/api/example`, ngrok returns a
custom plain text response with a status code of `418`. The response includes a
`content-type: text/plain` header and a body that uses multiple string
interpolations to show the connection start time and the current time.
