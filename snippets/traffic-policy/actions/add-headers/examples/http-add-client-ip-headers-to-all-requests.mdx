#### Adding Client IP Headers to all HTTP requests

The following [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/)
configuration will add the client IP address to all HTTP requests.

##### Example Traffic Policy Document

<CodeGroup>
```yaml policy.yml {4-7}
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: add-headers
        config:
          headers:
            x-client-ip: ${conn.client_ip}
```

```json policy.json {5-12}
{
  "on_http_request": [
    {
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "add-headers",
          "config": {
            "headers": {
              "x-client-ip": "${conn.client_ip}"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
</CodeGroup>

For this example, we are assuming that ngrok is pointing at the upstream service
https://httpbin.org and we are adding the following header to all requests:

- `x-client-ip` with the value `${conn.client_ip}` to demonstrate the use of
  CEL interpolation to include the client IP address.

#### Example Request

```bash
$ curl -i https://httpbin.ngrok.app/get
```

```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
content-type: application/json

{
  "headers": {
    "X-Client-Ip": "2600:1700:4fa6:1a00:2051:938:7373:5563",
  }
}
```
