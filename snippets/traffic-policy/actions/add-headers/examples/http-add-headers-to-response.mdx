### Adding headers to an HTTP response

The following [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/)
configuration will add headers to the response from the upstream service when
the method is `GET` and the URL starts with `/status/200`.

#### Example Traffic Policy Document

<CodeGroup>
```yaml policy.yml {6-10}
on_http_response:
  - expressions:
      - req.method == "GET" && req.url.path.startsWith("/status/200")
    actions:
      - type: add-headers
        config:
          headers:
            x-custom-header: my-custom-value
            x-string-interpolation-example: started at ${conn.ts.start}
```

```json policy.json {8-16}
{
	"on_http_response": [
		{
			"expressions": [
				"req.method == \"GET\" && req.url.path.startsWith(\"/status/200\")"
			],
			"actions": [
				{
					"type": "add-headers",
					"config": {
						"headers": {
							"x-custom-header": "my-custom-value",
							"x-string-interpolation-example": "started at ${conn.ts.start}"
						}
					}
				}
			]
		}
	]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

For this example, we are assuming that ngrok is pointing at the upstream service
https://httpbin.org and we will be adding two headers:

- `x-custom-header` with the value `my-custom-value`
- `x-string-interpolation-example` with the value `started at ${conn.ts.start}`
  to demonstrate the use of CEL interpolation to include the request connection
  start time.

### Example Request

```bash
$ curl -i https://httpbin.ngrok.app/status/200
```

```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
x-custom-header: my-custom-value
x-string-interpolation-example: started at 2024-07-13T00:10:16Z
```
