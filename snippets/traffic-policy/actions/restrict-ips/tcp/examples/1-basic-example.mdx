### Restricting Access with Allow and Deny Lists

The following [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy)
configuration demonstrates how to restrict access to specific IP addresses
using the `restrict-ips` action.

#### Example Traffic Policy Document

<CodeGroup>
```yaml policy.yml {4-10}
on_tcp_connect:
  - actions:
      - type: restrict-ips
        config:
          enforce: true
          allow:
            - 1.1.1.1/32
          deny:
            - e680:5791:be4c:5739:d959:7b94:6d54:d4b4/128
```

```json policy.json {5-16}
{
	"on_tcp_connect": [
		{
			"actions": [
				{
					"type": "restrict-ips",
					"config": {
						"enforce": true,
						"allow": ["1.1.1.1/32"],
						"deny": ["e680:5791:be4c:5739:d959:7b94:6d54:d4b4/128"]
					}
				}
			]
		}
	]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

This configuration will ensure that only requests from the IP `1.1.1.1` are
allowed, while requests from the IP `e680:5791:be4c:5739:d959:7b94:6d54:d4b4`
are denied.

#### Example Request

If the request comes from an allowed IP, the response will proceed as normal. If
the request comes from a denied IP, the connection will be closed:

```bash
$ telnet 5.tcp.ngrok.io 22984

Trying...
Connected to 5.tcp.ngrok.io.
Connection closed by foreign host.
```
