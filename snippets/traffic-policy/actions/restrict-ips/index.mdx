## Overview

The **Restrict IPs** Traffic Policy action allows you to allow or deny traffic based on the source IP address of connections to your ngrok endpoints.

You can define rules using either **Allow and Deny lists**, or **Reference IDs** to existing ngrok [IP Policies](/api/resources/ip-policies/).
