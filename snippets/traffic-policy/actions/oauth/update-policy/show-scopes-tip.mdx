<Note>
You may add [any scopes](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/review/login-permissions) that are required by your application with the following caveats.

- Scopes which require a Facebook [app review](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/review/#app-review) are unsupported.
- ngrok will enforce that users [accept all permissions](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/handling-declined-permissions#reprompt) before completing authorization.
