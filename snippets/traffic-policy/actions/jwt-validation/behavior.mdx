## Behavior

### Request Validation

The request is allowed only if it has been correctly signed by the issuer and the defined claims match.

For efficient validation of tokens, it is recommended to include the optional `kid` claim in your JWTs and JWK payload.

Custom validation can be implemented in Traffic Policies via the [`actions.ngrok.jwt_validation.tokens`](#action-result-variables) Action Result Variable and its corresponding properties.

### Multiple Issuers

You can specify multiple issuers for JWT validation.
A request is considered validated if it presents a JWT signed by any of the specified issuers.

The issuer **must** exactly match the one provided in the JWT, including any trailing slashes (`/`) present in the `iss` claim.

### Multiple Audience Claims

You can optionally specify one or more audience (`aud`) claims for JWT validation.

If present, the `aud` claim **must** contain at least one of the specified audience claims and exactly match for validation to succeed.

### Multiple Signing Keys

You can provide multiple JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) URLs and signing algorithms.

During JWT validation the list of JWKS and algorithms provided will be used in an attempt to validate the JWT.
The list will be tried in order and is cached for performance.
The cache is refreshed roughly every 15 minutes.

### Multiple Tokens

If multiple tokens are defined within the HTTP configuration parameter, all tokens **must** be present in the request.
If all tokens are not present, a `401 Unauthorized` status code will be returned.
