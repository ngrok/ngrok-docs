### Redirect using Paths

The following [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/)
configuration demonstrates how to use the `redirect` action to redirect incoming
requests from `/products` to `/store/products`.

#### Example Traffic Policy Document

<CodeGroup>
```yaml policy.yml {4-13}
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: redirect
        config:
          from: /products
          to: /store/products
```

```json policy.json {5-12}
{
	"on_http_request": [
		{
			"actions": [
				{
					"type": "redirect",
					"config": {
						"from": "/products",
						"to": "/store/products"
					}
				}
			]
		}
	]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

This configuration will redirect any request from `/products` to `/store/products`
with the default `302 Found` status code.

#### Example Request

```bash
$ curl -i https://example.ngrok.app/products
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
location: https://example.ngrok.app/store/products
```

In this example, a request to `/products` will be redirected to `/store/products`
with a `302 Found` status code, and the `Location` header will indicate the new
URL.
