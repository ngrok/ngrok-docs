## Overview

The **OWASP CRS Request** Traffic Policy action enables OWASP (Open Worldwide Application Security Project) CRS (previously Core Rule Set), a set of generic attack detection rules for use with ModSecurity or compatible web application firewalls.
It aims to protect web applications from a wide range of attacks, including the [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/), with a minimum of false alerts.
CRS provides protection against many common attack categories, including SQL Injection, Cross Site Scripting, Local File Inclusion, etc.

The `owasp-crs-request` action only enables rule processing on _incoming_ HTTP requests to your endpoint.
In addition to this action, we also recommend you enable the [OWASP CRS Response action](/traffic-policy/actions/owasp-crs-response/) to analyze _outgoing_ HTTP responses from your endpoint.
