### Rewrite using CEL Interpolation

The following [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/)
configuration demonstrates how to use the `url-rewrite` action to transparently
rewrite the request URL from `/products/*` to `/products.php` using a global
policy rule (no expression) by leveraging [CEL Interpolation](/traffic-policy/concepts/cel-interpolation).

#### Example Traffic Policy Document

<CodeGroup>
```yaml policy.yml {4-13}
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: url-rewrite
        config:
          from: ${req.url.authority}/products/?([.*]+)?
          to: /products.php?query=$1
```

```json policy.json {5,8-14}
{
	"on_http_request": [
		{
			"actions": [
				{
					"type": "url-rewrite",
					"config": {
						"from": "${req.url.authority}/products/?([.*]+)?",
						"to": "/products.php?query=$1"
					}
				}
			]
		}
	]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

This configuration will rewrite any request urls that start with `/products/*`
to `/products.php?query=$1` without changing the URL seen by the client. It does
this by leveraging [CEL Interpolation](/traffic-policy/concepts/cel-interpolation) to replace the
`from` value with the request URL authority. This is useful for hiding away the
underlying implementation details of your service.

#### Example Request

```bash
$ curl -i https://example.ngrok.app/products/123
```

```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
```

##### Example Server Logs

```http
GET /product.php?query=123          200 OK
```

#### Conclusion

In this example, a request to `/products` is internally routed to
`/products.php?query=123`, and the response is served from `products.php` while
the client remains unaware of the URL rewrite.
