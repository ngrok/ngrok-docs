## IP Categories

The following categories are available to use with the IP Intelligence `.categories` list.

The categories are hierarchal and can be matched at any level needed. For example, an IP with the category of `com.cloudflare.ipv4` also has the categories
`com` and `com.cloudflare`. This can be helpful if you want to allow all IPs from Cloudflare using `com.cloudflare` which would have both ipv4 and ipv6 lists.

Here's an example of how to block Tor exit node IPs from accessing your endpoint.

<CodeGroup>
```yaml policy.yml
expressions:
  - "('proxy.anonymous.tor' in conn.client_ip.categories)"
```
```json policy.json
{
  "expressions": [
    "('proxy.anonymous.tor' in conn.client_ip.categories)"
  ]
}
```
</CodeGroup>

Or you can block all anonymous proxies which would include Tor as well as any other lists with the `proxy.anonymous` category.

<CodeGroup>
```yaml policy.yml
expressions:
  - "('proxy.anonymous' in conn.client_ip.categories)"
```
```json policy.json
{
  "expressions": [
    "('proxy.anonymous' in conn.client_ip.categories)"
  ]
}
```
</CodeGroup>
