### Additional Information

If you are seeing an error such as: `ERROR: Invalid configuration property value for 'http_proxy': URL scheme must be 'http' or 'https'`, this means that you have a value set for the environment variable `http_proxy` or `http_proxy_env` and that it does not include the scheme in he value. If you are trying to use a proxy with ngrok, try updating the value of the env variable to include the proper scheme. If you are not trying to use ngrok with a proxy, then you will need to unset those env values before starting ngrok.
