description: Learn about the ngrok Kubernetes Operator for providing secure ingress to your Kubernetes applications using custom resources, Ingress, and Gateway API.
---

The ngrok Kubernetes Operator exposes Kubernetes services to the public internet using Ingress, Gateway API, or custom resources. 
It translates Kubernetes configuration into ngrok endpoints, enabling developers to self-service endpoints to their apps and services using a shared ngrok account.

## Concepts

<Columns cols={1}>
	<Card title="How it Works" href="/k8s/how-it-works/" horizontal>
		Understand how the Operator establishes secure connections and routes traffic to your Kubernetes services.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Architecture" href="/k8s/installation/architecture/" horizontal>
		Understand the Operator's control loops and design.

	<Card title="Load Balancing" href="/k8s/load-balancing/load-balancing-kubernetes/" horizontal>
		Distribute traffic across multiple Kubernetes services.
	</Card>
</Columns>

## Features

- [Custom Domains](/k8s/guides/custom-domain/) - Configure endpoints with your own domain names.
- [Traffic Policy](/k8s/crds/ngroktrafficpolicy/) - Apply advanced traffic management policies to your endpoints.
- [Observability](/k8s/installation/observability/) - Monitor and observe your Operator deployment.
