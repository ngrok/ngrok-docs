description: Learn about the ngrok Kubernetes Operator for providing secure ingress to your k8s applications.
---

The ngrok Kubernetes Operator exposes your Kubernetes services securely using standard Kubernetes resources like Ingress or the Gateway API.
With the Operator, teams can create and manage ngrok endpoints for their apps using a shared ngrok account.

Optionally, bindings let you make services running elsewhere (including your local machine or another cluster) appear inside a cluster as normal Kubernetes Services.
This enables private, cross-cluster connectivity without publishing publicly accessible URLs.
