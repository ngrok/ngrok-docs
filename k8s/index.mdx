description: Learn about the ngrok Kubernetes Operator for exposing Kubernetes services to the public internet using Ingress, Gateway API, or custom resources.
---

The ngrok Kubernetes Operator exposes Kubernetes services to the public internet using Ingress, Gateway API, or custom resources. It translates Kubernetes configuration into ngrok endpoints, enabling developers to self-service endpoints to their apps and services using a shared ngrok account.

## Concepts

<Columns cols={1}>
	<Card title="Kubernetes Ingress" href="/getting-started/kubernetes/ingress/" horizontal>
		Use standard Kubernetes Ingress resources for simple, drop-in HTTP routing to your services.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Gateway API" href="/getting-started/kubernetes/gateway-api/" horizontal>
		Use cross-platform Gateway API resources for advanced traffic management and transformations.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Custom Resources" href="/getting-started/kubernetes/crds/" horizontal>
		Use ngrok's native custom resources for complete control over traffic with features like OAuth/OIDC, rate limiting, and more.
	</Card>
	<Card title="How it Works" href="/k8s/how-it-works/" horizontal>
		Understand how the Operator establishes secure connections and routes traffic to your Kubernetes services.
	</Card>
</Columns>

## Features

- [Architecture](/k8s/installation/architecture/) - Understand the Operator's control loops and design.
- [Load Balancing](/k8s/load-balancing/load-balancing-kubernetes/) - Distribute traffic across multiple Kubernetes services.
- [Custom Domains](/k8s/guides/custom-domain/) - Configure endpoints with your own domain names.
- [Traffic Policy](/k8s/crds/ngroktrafficpolicy/) - Apply advanced traffic management policies to your endpoints.
- [Observability](/k8s/installation/observability/) - Monitor and observe your Operator deployment.
