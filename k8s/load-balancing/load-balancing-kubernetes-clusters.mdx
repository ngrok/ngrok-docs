title: Load Balancing Between Multiple Kubernetes Clusters
sidebarTitle: For Kubernetes Clusters
description: Use Endpoint Pooling to split traffic between any number of clusters without needing to deploy external services.

Let's say you have three services, `foo`, `bar`, and `baz`, deployed in a single
Kubernetes cluster, but eventually decide you need to extend to multiple
clusters for reasons like:

- Redundancy and failover
- Load distribution and scalability
- Hosting services close to your customers in different regions
- Deploying some clusters on-premises and others with a cloud provider

With ngrok, you don't need to provision new load balancers or other complex
networking tools—[Endpoint
Pooling](/universal-gateway/endpoint-pooling/) lets you share traffic between
replicas of your services on any number of clusters by deploying them on the same
[internal](/universal-gateway/internal-endpoints/) URL. With the addition
of a [Cloud Endpoint](/universal-gateway/cloud-endpoints) and [Traffic
Policy](/traffic-policy), you'll have a single "front door" for all your
load-balanced K8s services behind a single hostname, like
`https://api.example.com`.

<Tip>
	We have another guide for load balancing to [individual K8s
	services](/k8s/load-balancing/load-balancing-kubernetes) with ngrok custom
	resources, Ingress objects, or Gateway API resources. This guide uses our
	[custom resources](/k8s/guides/using-crds) to create endpoints for your
	services.
</Tip>

## 1. Install the ngrok Kubernetes Operator

Check out our [installation instructions](/k8s/installation/helm/) for
details on how to use Helm to deploy the open-source Operator to each cluster
you'd like to load-balance between.

## 2. Create internal Agent Endpoints on your first cluster

The following YAML manifest creates three internal agent endpoints, each of which
will proxy traffic to your `foo`, `bar`, and `baz` pods, respectively. When you
use our custom resources to create agent endpoints, pooling is [enabled
automatically](/k8s/guides/pooling/#endpoint-pooling-with-agentendpoints).

```yaml
apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
kind: AgentEndpoint
metadata:
	name: foo
	namespace: default
spec:
	upstream:
		url: http://foo.default:8001
	url: https://foo.internal
---
apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
kind: AgentEndpoint
metadata:
	name: bar
	namespace: default
spec:
	upstream:
		url: http://bar.default:8002
	url: https://bar.internal
---
apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
kind: AgentEndpoint
metadata:
	name: baz
	namespace: default
spec:
	upstream:
		url: http://baz.default:8003
	url: https://baz.internal
```

Save it to your local workstation as `ingress.yaml` and apply to your cluster
with `kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml`.

These internal agent endpoints won't yet be available to public traffic, because
they are only accessible through other ngrok endpoints in your account, but
you'll fix that in the next two steps.

Repeat the process on any other clusters you want to load balance traffic
between.

## 4. Create a Cloud Endpoint and add routing with Traffic Policy

If you don't yet have a reserved domain, go ahead and [reserve
one](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains) in the dashboard.

The easiest way to create a cloud endpoint is in the [**Endpoint**
section](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/endpoints) of your ngrok dashboard.

Click **New**, then **Cloud Endpoint**. Leave the binding as **Public** and
fill in the full URL of the domain you reserved, then click **Create Cloud
Endpoint**.

The following traffic policy example:

1. Uses the [`forward-internal`
   action](/traffic-policy/actions/forward-internal/) to route all requests to
   the `/foo` path to the pool you created at `https://foo.internal`. - The pooled endpoints then proxy requests proxies the request to the `foo`
   Service/Deployment in your cluster.
2. Does the same for the paths `/bar` and `/baz`.
3. Denies all traffic to paths that don't (yet) have a service.

```yaml
on_http_request:
  - expressions:
      - req.url.path.startsWith('/foo')
    actions:
      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: https://foo.internal
  - expressions:
      - req.url.path.startsWith('/bar')
    actions:
      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: https://bar.internal
  - expressions:
      - req.url.path.startsWith('/baz')
    actions:
      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: https://baz.internal
  - actions:
      - type: deny
        config:
          status_code: 404
```

Paste the YAML above into the dashboard and click **Save**.

Now, when you request `https://api.example.com/foo` or any other route, your
traffic will be automatically load-balanced between replicas of your services on
multiple Kubernetes clusters.

## What's next?

With load balancing solved for, you can now add new services or entire
Kubernetes clusters by adding new endpoints to existing pools or configuring new
routes with traffic policy.

Speaking of traffic policy, here are a few common ways folks filter, manage, and
orchestrate requests:

- [Route requests by subdomain or
  header](/traffic-policy/examples/route-requests/) instead of paths.
- Add authentication with the
  [`basic-auth`](/traffic-policy/actions/basic-auth/),
  [`oauth`](/traffic-policy/actions/oauth/), or
  [`jwt-validation`](/traffic-policy/actions/jwt-validation/) Traffic
  Policy actions.
- [Rate limit requests](/traffic-policy/actions/rate-limit/) to prevent
  abuse and ensure fairness.

Or, if you're looking for a more step-by-step experience for deploying ngrok as
an API gateway, check out our guides:

  gateway](/k8s/load-balancing/load-balancing-kubernetes-clusters/)
