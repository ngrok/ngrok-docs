## CloudEndpoint Custom Resource

### **apiVersion:** `ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1`

### **kind:** `CloudEndpoint`

The `CloudEndpoint` custom resource is used to create centrally managed endpoints in the cloud. Cloud Endpoints are persistent, always-on endpoints that live within the ngrok cloud.
They exist permanently until they are explicitly deleted. Cloud Endpoints do not forward their traffic to an agent by default and instead only use their attached Traffic Policy to handle connections.
Using the traffic policy configuration, you may configure your Cloud Endpoints to route to one or more other internal ngrok endpoints.

For more information about cloud endpoints in ngrok, refer to the [cloud endpoints page](/universal-gateway/cloud-endpoints/)

### `spec.url`

The unique URL for this cloud endpoint. This URL defines how the endpoint is accessed.

**Type:** `string`

**Required:** yes

**Default:** none

The following formats are accepted:

- **Domain**
  - When using the domain format you are only defining the domain. The scheme and port will be inferred.
  - example: `example.org`
- **Origin**
  - When using the origin format you are defining the protocol, domain and port. HTTP endpoints accept ports `80` or `443` with respective protocol.
  - examples:
    - `https://example.ngrok.app`
    - `https://example.ngrok.app:443`
    - `tcp://1.tcp.ngrok.io:12345`
    - `tls://example.ngrok.app`
- **Scheme (shorthand)**
  - When using scheme you are defining the protocol and will receive back a randomly assigned ngrok address.
  - examples:
    - `https://`
    - `tcp://`
    - `tls://`
    - `http://`
- **Empty**
  When empty your endpoint will default to be https and receive back a randomly assigned ngrok address.
- **Internal**
  - When ending your url with .internal, an internal endpoint will be created. Internal Endpoints cannot be accessed directly, but rather
    can only be accessed using the forward-internal traffic policy action.
  - example: `some.domain.internal`

### `spec.trafficPolicyName`

Reference to an `NgrokTrafficPolicy` custom resource in the same namespace as the `CloudEndpoint` to use for traffic policy configuration.
It is invalid to configure both `spec.trafficPolicyName` and `spec.trafficPolicy` at the same time.

The referenced `NgrokTrafficPolicy` **must** be in the same namespace as the `CloudEndpoint`.

**Type:** `string`

**Required:** no

**Default:** none

### `spec.trafficPolicy`

Reference to an `NgrokTrafficPolicy` custom resource in the same namespace as the `CloudEndpoint` to use for traffic policy configuration.
It is invalid to configure both `spec.trafficPolicyName` and `spec.trafficPolicy` at the same time.
For more information about writing ngrok traffic policies, refer to the [traffic policy section](/traffic-policy/).

**Type:** `Object`

**Required:** no

**Default:** none

**Fields:**

| Field Name                                              | Type              | Required | Default | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | -------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`spec.trafficPolicy.policy`](#spectrafficpolicypolicy) | `json.RawMessage` | yes      | none    | The inline traffic policy configuration to be used for this `CloudEndpoint` |

### `spec.trafficPolicy.policy`

Allows you to supply a traffic policy for this `AgentEndpoint` with inline configuration. An example has been included below.
For more information about writing ngrok traffic policies, refer to the [traffic policy section](/traffic-policy/).

**Type:** `json.RawMessage`

**Required:** yes

**Default:** none

### `spec.description`

Human-readable description of this cloud endpoint that can be used to help identify/describe it.

**Type:** `string`

**Required:** no

**Default:** `"Created by the ngrok-operator"`

### `spec.metadata`

String of arbitrary data associated with the object in the ngrok API/Dashboard.

**Type:** `string`

**Required:** no

**Default:** `"{"owned-by":"ngrok-operator"}"`

### `spec.bindings`

List of Binding IDs to associate with the endpoint

**Type:** `string` (enum)

**Required:** no

**Default:** none

**Accepted Values:** `"public"`, `"internal"`, or `"kubernetes"`

- A binding of `"internal"` will create an internal `AgentEndpoint` that is only accessible from other endpoints using the `forward-internal` traffic policy action.
  - Aside from setting `bindings: ["internal"]`, the `spec.url` of the `AgentEndpoint` must end in `.internal`
  - Setting `bindings: ["public"]` will not work for internal endpoints (endpoints that have a `spec.url` ending in `.internal`)
- A binding of `"public"` will create a standard `AgentEndpoint` with its `spec.url` accessible to the public internet
  - Setting `bindings: ["internal"]` will not work for public endpoints
- A binding of `"kubernetes"` will create a Kubernetes bound endpoint. This causes the endpoint to not be publicly accessible to the public internet
  and will be projected into one or more of your Kubernetes clusters that are running the ngrok operator (depending on their endpoint selector configuration) as `Services`.
  - With a `"kubernetes"` binding, the `spec.url` becomes the `name.namespace` of the projected Service.
  - For example, with a `spec.url` of `http://my-service.my-namespace` then a Service with name `my-service` in the `my-namespace` namespace will be created by the ngrok operator.
    Other services within the Kubernetes cluster can make requests to this endpoint. This enables many different use-cases such as being able to project a service in one Kubernetes cluster
    to another Kubernetes cluster so that services running in the other cluster can make requests to it. This has the benefit of not needing to expose the endpoint to the public internet behind a publicly accessible URL.

### `spec.poolingEnabled`

Configures whether [pooling](/universal-gateway/endpoint-pooling) is always enabled for this `CloudEndpoint`.

When pooling is enabled, if two different endpoints share the same `spec.url` then requests will be balanced between them.
This is not limited to endpoints within the same cluster, or endpoints of the same type. For example, a `CloudEndpoint` can be pooled with an agent endpoint created using the ngrok CLI if they both enable pooling and share the same URL.

It is recommended to include a prefix/suffix in the url to prevent unintended pooling. For example, if you are running a service `foo` in the namespace `bar` in two different
Kubernetes clusters, you may want to give each one a slightly different `spec.url` that includes something such as a cluster identifier to prevent requests from being balanced between them.

You will receive an error back from the ngrok server if you attempt to create two different endpoints using the same URL if they do not both enable pooling.
In this scenario, the older endpoint wins and the newer one will fail to be created.

**Type:** `bool`

**Required:** no

**Default:** `false`

## Example CloudEndpoints

### CloudEndpoint with inline traffic policy

The following `CloudEndpoint`:

- Accepts traffic on the URL `https://example-cloud-endpoint.ngrok.io`
