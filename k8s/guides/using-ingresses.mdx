## How the ngrok Operator uses Ingresses

The ngrok Kubernetes Operator consumes `Ingress` resources and translates them into the native ngrok `CloudEndpoint` and `AgentEndpoint` custom resources.
Each hostname from the `Ingress` resources you configure will cause the Operator to create a `CloudEndpoint` for the hostname.
Each unique upstream service you reference using `HTTPRoute` resources will cause the Operator to create an `AgentEndpoint` with an `internal` binding so that it is not accessible directly on the internet.
The Operator then generates ngrok [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/) configuration on those `CloudEndpoint` to perform all the routing and actions specified in your Gateway API configuration and route to the internal `AgentEndpoint` resources that handle forwarding traffic to your upstream services.
When you create/update/delete Gateway API resources, the Operator will automatically handle creating/updating/deleting the `CloudEndpoint` and `AgentEndpoint` resources as needed.

## Fan-out versus multiple

The Operator supports using a single ingress for your hostname that includes several rules such as the below example.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example-ingress
  namespace: default
spec:
  ingressClassName: ngrok
  rules:
    - host: example-ingress.ngrok.io
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /foo
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: foo-service
                port:
                  number: 80
          - path: /bar
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: bar-service
                port:
                  number: 80
```

Or you can create multiple different `Ingress` resources that produce the same effect such as the example below.
The Operator will translate both examples into the same configuration.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example-ingress-foo
  namespace: default
spec:
  ingressClassName: ngrok
  rules:
    - host: example-ingress.ngrok.io
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /foo
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: foo-service
                port:
                  number: 80
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example-ingress-bar
  namespace: default
spec:
  ingressClassName: ngrok
  rules:
    - host: example-ingress.ngrok.io
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /bar
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: bar-service
                port:
                  number: 80
```

## Using `NgrokTrafficPolicy` with `Ingress`

To extend the functionality of `Ingress` resources, you have the option of combining them with `NgrokTrafficPolicy` resources to take advantage of ngrok's [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/) system.

`NgrokTrafficPolicy` can be used with `Ingress` resources in three different ways:

- As an annotation
  - When supplied via an annotation, the rules from the `NgrokTrafficPolicy` run first when requests are sent to any endpoints created for the `Ingress` before any rules from Traffic Policies supplied as backends or the default backend.
  - If used in this way, the Traffic Policy may "terminate" the request by sending back a response or by forwarding to another endpoint using the `forward-internal` action, but if done so, then the request will not be further processed by any other rules in the `Ingress`.
  - This can allow you to enforce common actions such as header manipulation or authentication for any request matching the ingress regardless of which `Ingress` rule the request may match.
- As the backend for a specific rule
  - `NgrokTrafficPolicy` resources can be used in place of a `Service` for the backend of an Ingress rule.
  - When used this way, the rules from these Traffic Policies are executed after any Traffic Policy rules from an annotation `NgrokTrafficPolicy` (if supplied) and only if the request matches the `Ingress` rule.
    Since the `NgrokTrafficPolicy` is used in-place of a `Service` it is expected that the `NgrokTrafficPolicy` will "terminate" the request either by sending back the response on its own, or forwarding to another endpoint using the `forward-internal` action.
- As the default backend
  - You may use an `NgrokTrafficPolicy` as the default backend of your `Ingress`. The rules from the Traffic Policy will only be executed if the request does not match any of your other `Ingress` rules.
  - Since the `NgrokTrafficPolicy` is used in-place of a `Service` it is expected that the `NgrokTrafficPolicy` will "terminate" the request either by sending back the response on its own, or forwarding to another endpoint using the `forward-internal` action.

You can use one or multiple of the above options depending on your use-case and preferences.

The following example shows how you can supply an `NgrokTrafficPolicy` to an `Ingress` using an annotation.
It must be in the same namespace as the `Ingress`.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    k8s.ngrok.com/traffic-policy: my-ngroktrafficpolicy
  name: example-ingress
  namespace: default
spec:
  ingressClassName: ngrok
  rules:
    - host: example-ingress.ngrok.io
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: example-service
                port:
                  number: 80
```

The following example shows how you can supply an `NgrokTrafficPolicy` to an `Ingress` as the backend for a specific rule.
It must be in the same namespace as the `Ingress`.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example-ingress
  namespace: default
spec:
  ingressClassName: ngrok
  rules:
    - host: example-ingress.ngrok.io
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              resource:
                apiGroup: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com
                kind: NgrokTrafficPolicy
                name: my-ngroktrafficpolicy
```

The following example shows how you can supply an `NgrokTrafficPolicy` to an `Ingress` as the default backend.
It must be in the same namespace as the `Ingress`.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example-ingress
  namespace: default
spec:
  ingressClassName: ngrok
  defaultBackend:
    resource:
      apiGroup: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com
      kind: NgrokTrafficPolicy
      name: my-ngroktrafficpolicy
  rules:
    - host: example-ingress.ngrok.io
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: example-service
                port:
                  number: 80
```

## Ingress HTTPS upstreams

If you have an Ingress that routes to a Service that expects HTTPS instead of HTTP, you can specify this using the `k8s.ngrok.com/app-protocols` annotation on your `Service`.
For example, the following `Service` uses the annotation to let the Operator know which ports use HTTPS

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: example-service
  labels:
    app: example-app
  annotations:
    k8s.ngrok.com/app-protocols: '{"https-port":"https","http-port":"http"}'
spec:
  ports:
    - name: https-port
      port: 443
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: 8443
    - name: http-port
      port: 80
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: example-app
```

## Ingress conflicts

In order to support the ability for users to configure multiple `Ingress` resources that use the same hostname like in the example above, the Operator enforces a requirement that all `Ingress` resources that use a given hostname must have the same configuration for the `k8s.ngrok.com/pooling-enabled` and `k8s.ngrok.com/traffic-policy` annotations.
This means that if you use an ingress such as the following example for `foo.ngrok.io`, any other `Ingress` using the `foo.ngrok.io` hostname **must** have the same pooling and Traffic Policy annotations as the one below.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    k8s.ngrok.com/traffic-policy: my-ngroktrafficpolicy
    k8s.ngrok.com/pooling-enabled: "true"
  name: example-ingress
  namespace: default
spec:
  ingressClassName: ngrok
  rules:
    - host: example-ingress.ngrok.io
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: example-service
                port:
                  number: 80
```
