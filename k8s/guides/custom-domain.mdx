description: Learn how to use custom domains with the ngrok Kubernetes Operator.

In the Kubernetes Ingress and Gateway API specs, both ingresses and routes can have multiple rules with different hostnames.
While standard ngrok domains are available for use immediately after reservation, custom white-label domains may require extra steps to set up.
This guide outlines your options for getting custom white-label domains working with the ngrok Kubernetes Operator.

## Managed by Kubernetes

If you have [ExternalDNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) installed and configured, you can create an Ingress object to fully automate the process of reserving a domain in ngrok, updating DNS records with your DNS provider to the ngrok-provided CNAME record, and receiving a TLS certificate.

If you aren't using ExternalDNS or a similar tool, you must manually create records for each Ingress or Gateway you provision.

### Ingress

If you create an ingress object (k8s ingress) or route object (Gateway API) with a hostname that isn't a standard ngrok domain, the Operator will attempt to create a custom white-label domain for you.
This domain will be reserved and registered with ngrok but you must configure its DNS records before you can use it.
This will be registered in the ngrok API and also show up as a domain CRD.

For example, if you create an ingress object like the one shown below, the Operator will attempt to reserve and register the domain `foo.bar.com` with ngrok:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example-ingress
spec:
  rules:
    - host: foo.bar.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: service1
                port:
                  number: 80
```

This will be registered in the ngrok API and also show up as a domain CRD.
The Operator will then wait for the DNS records to be configured for this domain.
Once the DNS records are configured, the Operator will configure the endpoint to route traffic to the ingress or route object.

You should be able to see the domain CRD via kubectl:

```shell
kubectl get domains.ingress.k8s.ngrok.com
```

For custom domains, the domain resource contains the CNAME target value that needs to be created for DNS resolution and certificates to work properly.
This value is added to the ingress or route object's `status.loadBalancer.ingress` field.

`kubectl get ingress -o yaml example-ingress`

```yaml
Status:
  loadBalancer:
    ingress:
      - hostname: abc123.def456.ngrok-cname.com
```

### Gateway

Using a custom domain with the Gateway API is similar to the Ingress example above.

If you create the following Gateway, the ngrok-operator will reserve the domain for you:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: example-gateway
spec:
  gatewayClassName: ngrok
  listeners:
    - allowedRoutes:
        kinds:
          - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
            kind: HTTPRoute
        namespaces:
          from: All
      hostname: foo.bar.com
      name: http
      port: 443
      protocol: HTTPS
```

It will also populate the Gateway's `status.addresses` field:

```yaml
status:
  addresses:
    - type: Hostname
      value: abc123.def456.ngrok-cname.com
```

## Externally managed

Domains can also be created in the dashboard, or via the ngrok API or Terraform provider.

If created externally, the Operator will discover the domain is already registered and won't interact with it unless you modify or delete the CRD itself.
Deleting the ingress objects that use that host won't result in the domain CRD being deleted.
