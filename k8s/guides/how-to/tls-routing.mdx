title: TLS Routing
---

Transport Layer Security (TLS) routing enables your API Gateway to handle encrypted traffic based on the Server Name Indication (SNI) without needing to terminate the connection. By default, TLS traffic is routed without termination, preserving full end-to-end encryption. However, TLS termination can be enabled if your use case requires it.

Proper TLS routing enables:

🔒 End-to-end encryption by default, with optional termination. <br /> 🌐 SNI-based routing to differentiate between secure services. <br /> 🏗 Support for multi-tenant architectures using a single IP and port. <br />

## 🔍 What are the Benefits of TLS Routing?

TLS routing is ideal for environments where secure communication must be preserved from client to backend.
With SNI-based routing, the gateway can route requests without accessing the payload, maintaining user privacy and compliance.

A well-configured API Gateway can route TLS traffic using:

- SNI-based rules (for example, api.example.com → API service, auth.example.com → Auth service).
- TLS passthrough (default): Maintain end-to-end encryption without terminating TLS at the gateway.
- TLS termination (optional): Handle TLS termination at the gateway if you don't want your upstream services to terminate TLS.

## TLS Routing Examples

The following examples showcase how you can route TLS traffic to your upstream services.

See the [TLS Endpoints page](/universal-gateway/tls/) for more details on how ngrok handles TLS endpoints.

	<Tab title="AgentEndpoint">
	```yaml
  apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
  kind: AgentEndpoint
  metadata:
    name: example-service
    namespace: default
  spec:
    url: tls://example-hostname.ngrok.io:8443
    upstream:
      url: tls://example-service.example-namespace:8443
	```
	</Tab>
	<Tab title="CloudEndpoint with AgentEndpoint">

    ### 1. Create an `AgentEndpoint` for your upstream `Service`
    ```yaml

apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
kind: AgentEndpoint
metadata:
name: example-service
namespace: default
spec:
url: tls://example-service.internal:8443
upstream:
url: tls://example-service.example-namespace:8443
```

    ### 2. Create a `CloudEndpoint` that routes to the `AgentEndpoint`

    ```yaml

apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
kind: CloudEndpoint
metadata:
name: example-cloud-endpoint
spec:
url: tls://example-hostname.ngrok.io:8443
trafficPolicy:
policy:
on_http_request: - actions: - type: forward-internal
config:
url: tls://example-service.internal:8443
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Gateway API">

    For TLS and TCP Routes, you must put the domain in the `Gateway.Spec.Addresses` field as the ngrok operator needs to know what domains to use when creating endpoints for you and Gateway API forbids using the hostname field
    on Gateway listeners for TCP/TLS protocols.

    Since the `Gateway.Spec.Addresses` are expected to bind to all listeners, you may want to create separate Gateways for TLS and TCP endpoints to prevent unwanted conflicts and overlap.
    For these reasons, TCP and TLS routing is often more easily configurable using the `AgentEndpoint` resources directly instead of Gateway API configuration.

    ### 1. Create a `Gateway`

    If you already have a `Gateway` you can use that instead

    ```yaml

apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
name: example-gateway
namespace: default
spec:
gatewayClassName: ngrok
addresses: - type: Hostname
value: example-hostname.ngrok.io
listeners: - name: p9000
port: 9000
protocol: TLS
```

    ### 2. Create a `TLSRoute`

    ```yaml

apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2
kind: TLSRoute
metadata:
name: example-tlsroute
namespace: default
spec:
parentRefs: - name: example-gateway
sectionName: p9000
rules: - backendRefs: - name: example-service
port: 9000
```
