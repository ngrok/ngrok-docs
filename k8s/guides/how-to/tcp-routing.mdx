title: TCP Routing
description: Configure TCP routing in Kubernetes to handle raw network traffic for non-HTTP protocols like databases and game servers.
---

TCP routing allows an API Gateway to handle raw network traffic at the transport layer, enabling it to serve as an entry point for non-HTTP protocols such as databases, game servers, messaging brokers, or custom protocols.

Proper TCP routing makes it possible to:

🔁 Consolidate entry points for multiple TCP-based services. <br />
📡 Expose internal services to the internet with controlled access. <br />
🔌 Handle any binary or custom protocol without deep inspection. <br />

## 🔍 What are the benefits of TCP routing?

Unlike HTTP and TLS routing, TCP routing operates at Layer 4 of the OSI model.
The API Gateway uses the destination port or IP to determine the target backend—ideal for workloads that don't use HTTP.

With TCP routing, the gateway can route connections using:

- Port-based rules (for example, port 5432 → PostgreSQL service, port 4222 → NATS server).
- Static or dynamic IP/port mappings to backend services.
- Connection-level metadata, such as source IP or client certificate, if applicable.

Key Benefits:

- Protocol Agnostic Routing: Support non-HTTP services or custom TCP protocols.
- High Performance: Route traffic with minimal latency and overhead.
- Secure Exposure of Internal Services: Control who can access backend services on the transport layer.

## TCP routing examples

The following examples showcase how you can route TCP traffic to your upstream services.

You must first create a [TCP Address](/universal-gateway/tcp-addresses/).
When you create a TCP address, a random hostname and port will be assigned to you, for example, `1.tcp.ngrok.io:12345`.
See the [TCP Endpoints page](/universal-gateway/tcp/) for more details on how ngrok handles TCP endpoints.

<Tab title="AgentEndpoint">
```yaml
apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
kind: AgentEndpoint
metadata:
  name: example-service
  namespace: default
spec:
  url: tcp://1.tcp.ngrok.io:12345
  upstream:
    url: tcp://example-service.example-namespace:8443
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="CloudEndpoint with AgentEndpoint">

### 1. Create an `AgentEndpoint` for your upstream `Service`

```yaml
apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
kind: AgentEndpoint
metadata:
  name: example-service
  namespace: default
spec:
  url: tcp://example-service.internal:8443
  upstream:
    url: tcp://example-service.example-namespace:8443
```

### 2. Create a `CloudEndpoint` that routes to the `AgentEndpoint`

```yaml
apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
kind: CloudEndpoint
metadata:
  name: example-cloud-endpoint
spec:
  url: tcp://1.tcp.ngrok.io:12345
  trafficPolicy:
    policy:
      on_http_request:
        - actions:
            - type: forward-internal
              config:
                url: tcp://example-service.internal:8443
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Gateway API">

For TLS and TCP Routes, you must put the domain in the `Gateway.Spec.Addresses` field as the ngrok Operator needs to know what domains to use when creating endpoints for you and Gateway API forbids using the hostname field
on Gateway listeners for TCP/TLS protocols.

Since the `Gateway.Spec.Addresses` are expected to bind to all listeners, you may want to create separate Gateways for TLS and TCP endpoints to prevent unwanted conflicts and overlap.
For these reasons, TCP and TLS routing is often more easily configurable using the `AgentEndpoint` resources directly instead of Gateway API configuration.

### 1. Create a `Gateway`

If you already have a `Gateway` you can use that instead

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: example-gateway
  namespace: default
spec:
  gatewayClassName: ngrok
  addresses:
    - type: Hostname
      value: 1.tcp.ngrok.io
  listeners:
    - name: p12345
      port: 12345
      protocol: TCP
```

### 2. Create a `TCPRoute`

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2
kind: TCPRoute
metadata:
  name: example-tlsroute
  namespace: default
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: example-gateway
      sectionName: p12345
  rules:
    - backendRefs:
        - name: example-service
          port: 9000
```
