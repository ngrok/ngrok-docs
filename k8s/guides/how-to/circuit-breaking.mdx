title: Circuit Breaking for System Reliability
sidebarTitle: Circuit Breaking
description: Configure circuit breaking in Kubernetes to protect your services from overload and maintain system reliability with ngrok.
---

Circuit breaking is a resilience pattern that helps maintain system reliability by temporarily rejecting requests when error rates and request volumes exceed predefined thresholds. This prevents overloaded services from spiraling into failure and allows them time to recover.

When circuit breaking is enabled:

🚨 Requests are automatically rejected if too many errors occur within a given time window. <br />
⏳ Traffic pauses for a set period to allow the upstream service to recover. <br />
✅ The system automatically re-evaluates health and resumes traffic once conditions improve. <br />


## 🔍 What are the benefits of circuit breaking?

Modern applications often rely on multiple microservices, APIs, or external dependencies.
If one service becomes slow or fails, it can cause cascading failures across the entire system.

Key Benefits:

- Isolating failing services so they don't bring down the entire system.
- Reducing unnecessary load on struggling services.
- Ensuring graceful degradation instead of full service failure.
- If a downstream service becomes overloaded, circuit breaking can prevent other services from also failing.
- Prevents long wait times for users by cutting off slow or failing requests.
- Ensures high-priority services remain available even when others are experiencing high failure rates.

## Circuit breaking examples

The following examples show how to set up an endpoint that allows only 1 request every 60 seconds and trips the circuit breaker for 2 minutes.

Check out the [circuit breaking Traffic Policy action](/traffic-policy/actions/circuit-breaker/) page for more details about how it functions and the parameters it accepts.

<Tab title="Ingress">
💡 `Ingress` resources do not natively support circuit breaking, but they can be extended using a Traffic Policy.

### 1. Create an `NgrokTrafficPolicy`

```yaml
apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
kind: NgrokTrafficPolicy
metadata:
	name: example-tp
	namespace: default
spec:
	policy:
		on_http_request:
			- actions:
					- type: circuit-breaker
						config:
							error_threshold: 0
							volume_threshold: 1
							window_duration: 60s
							tripped_duration: 2m
							enforce: true
```

### 2. Use the `NgrokTrafficPolicy` on an `Ingress`

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
	annotations:
		k8s.ngrok.com/traffic-policy: example-tp
	name: example-ingress
	namespace: default
spec:
	ingressClassName: ngrok
	rules:
		- host: example-hostname.ngrok.io
			http:
				paths:
					- path: /
						pathType: Prefix
						backend:
							service:
								name: example-service
								port:
									number: 80
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Gateway API">
💡 Gateway API resources do not natively support circuit breaking, but they can be extended using a Traffic Policy.

### 1. Create an `NgrokTrafficPolicy`

```yaml
apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
kind: NgrokTrafficPolicy
metadata:
	name: example-tp
	namespace: default
spec:
	policy:
		on_http_request:
			- actions:
					- type: circuit-breaker
						config:
							error_threshold: 0
							volume_threshold: 1
							window_duration: 60s
							tripped_duration: 2m
							enforce: true
```

### 2. Use the `NgrokTrafficPolicy` on a `Gateway`

The following example showcases supplying the `NgrokTrafficPolicy` on a `Gateway` resource. All requests to the `Gateway` will run the Traffic Policy.
If you prefer, `NgrokTrafficPolicy` can also be used on the route level by using an `externalRef` filter on an `HTTPRoute`. See the [using Gateway API guide](/k8s/guides/using-gwapi) for examples.

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
	name: example-gateway
	namespace: default
	annotations:
		k8s.ngrok.com/traffic-policy: example-tp
spec:
	gatewayClassName: ngrok
	listeners:
		- name: example-hostname
			hostname: "example-hostname.ngrok.io"
			port: 443
		  protocol: HTTPS
```
