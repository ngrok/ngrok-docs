title: Protecting Services with Rate Limiting
sidebarTitle: Rate Limiting
---




Rate limiting is a critical feature that prevents your services from being overwhelmed by excessive network traffic. By enforcing rate limits, you can control how many requests are allowed over a given period, helping to:

⚡ Maintain API performance by preventing excessive load. <br />
🔐 Protect against abuse and malicious traffic. <br />
🌍 Ensure fair usage across clients and users. <br />


## 🔍 What are the Benefits of Rate Limiting?

Without rate limiting, a single misconfigured client or a spike in traffic could easily overload your backend.
Implementing rate limiting at the network edge helps prevent:

- API overuse and abuse (for example, DDoS attacks, aggressive polling).
- Performance degradation for other users.
- Unexpected infrastructure costs due to excessive traffic.

Key Benefits:

- **Prevents Service Overload:** Ensures API stability even under high traffic.
- **Protects Against Automated Abuse:** Stops bots and scrapers from overwhelming services.
- **Ensures Fair Usage:** Distributes API resources evenly among users.
- **Reduces Infrastructure Costs:** Avoids unnecessary scaling due to excessive requests.
- **Improves Security & Compliance:** Helps meet API quotas and prevent brute-force attacks.

## Rate Limiting Examples

The following examples demonstrate how to rate limit all incoming requests by the `Host` header.

Check out the [rate limit traffic policy action](/traffic-policy/actions/rate-limit/) page for more details about how it functions and the parameters it accepts.

	</Tab>
	<Tab title="Ingress">
	💡 `Ingress` resources do not natively support rate limiting, but they can be extended using a traffic policy.

	### 1. Create an `NgrokTrafficPolicy`

	```yaml
  apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
  kind: NgrokTrafficPolicy
  metadata:
    name: example-tp
    namespace: default
  spec:
    policy:
      on_http_request:
        - actions:
            - type: rate-limit
              config:
                name: Only allow 30 requests per minute
                algorithm: sliding_window
                capacity: 30
                rate: 60s
                bucket_key:
                  - req.headers['host']
	```

	### 2. Use the `NgrokTrafficPolicy` on an `Ingress`

	```yaml
  apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: Ingress
  metadata:
    annotations:
      k8s.ngrok.com/traffic-policy: example-tp
    name: example-ingress
    namespace: default
  spec:
    ingressClassName: ngrok
    rules:
      - host: example-hostname.ngrok.io
        http:
          paths:
            - path: /
              pathType: Prefix
              backend:
                service:
                  name: example-service
                  port:
                    number: 80
	```
	</Tab>
	<Tab title="Gateway API">
	💡 Gateway API resources do not natively support rate limiting, but they can be extended using a traffic policy.

	### 1. Create an `NgrokTrafficPolicy`

	```yaml
  apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
  kind: NgrokTrafficPolicy
  metadata:
    name: example-tp
    namespace: default
  spec:
    policy:
      on_http_request:
        - actions:
            - type: rate-limit
              config:
                name: Only allow 30 requests per minute
                algorithm: sliding_window
                capacity: 30
                rate: 60s
                bucket_key:
                  - req.headers['host']
	```
	### 2. Use the `NgrokTrafficPolicy` on a `Gateway`

	The following example showcases supplying the `NgrokTrafficPolicy` on a `Gateway` resource. All requests to the `Gateway` will run the traffic policy.
	If you prefer, `NgrokTrafficPolicy` can also be used on the route level by using an `externalRef` filter on an `HTTPRoute`. See the [using Gateway API guide](/k8s/guides/using-gwapi) for examples.

	```yaml
  apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: Gateway
  metadata:
    name: example-gateway
    namespace: default
    annotations:
      k8s.ngrok.com/traffic-policy: example-tp
  spec:
    gatewayClassName: ngrok
    listeners:
      - name: example-hostname
        hostname: "example-hostname.ngrok.io"
        port: 443
        protocol: HTTPS
