The following YAML block contains the default `values.yaml` used when installing the ngrok Kubernetes Operator. You can reference these values and change them individually with `--set` flags while installing/upgrading the ngrok Kubernetes Operator.

You can also see these values in [the ngrok Operator repo](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/blob/main/helm/ngrok-operator/values.yaml).

## Common configurations

This section provides some common use cases and recommendations when using this helm chart in a production setting. 

### Deployment scaling

By default, the replica count is set to 1 via `replicaCount`. Override this to 2 or more to ensure high availability during roll-outs and failures, and to spread out the load.

### ngrok region

ngrok runs globally distributed tunnel servers around the world to enable fast, low latency traffic to your applications. See [ngrok's points of presence](/universal-gateway/points-of-presence/) for more information on ngrok's regions.

Similar to the agent, if you do not explicitly pick a region via helm when installing the Operator, the Operator will attempt to pick the region with the least latency, which is usually the one geographically closest to your machine. Specifying a region applies this setting across all agent connect URLs in your cluster; regions cannot currently be configured on a per-connection basis.

See the [helm value `region`](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/blob/main/helm/ngrok-operator/values.yaml#L47) to configure a specific region for the controller to use.

### Watching specific namespaces

By default, the Operator watches all namespaces. It's a common use case to need a controller to watch only a specific namespace in the case where you may run a controller in a namespace for each team or environment. In order to watch only a specific namespace for ingress objects, you can set the helm value `watchNamespace` to the namespace you want to watch.
