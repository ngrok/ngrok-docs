description: Export AI Gateway logs to external systems.
---

You can export HTTP logs from your AI Gateway endpoints to external systems using ngrok's [Log Exporting](/obs/events) feature.

## Current support

<Note>
AI Gateway endpoints emit **standard ngrok traffic logs** (`http_request_complete.v0`). AI-specific log fields (provider selection, retry tracking, token usage) are not currently available but are on our roadmap.
</Note>

Log Exporting allows you to:

- Stream request/response logs to your analytics platform
- Archive traffic data for compliance
- Build custom dashboards and alerts
- Integrate with your existing observability stack

## Setting up log exporting

Log Exports are configured at the account level through the ngrok Dashboard:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Log Exporting">
    Go to [Log Exporting](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/log-exporting) in the ngrok Dashboard
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a New Log Export">
    Click to create a new Log Export
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Log Sources">
    Choose which log sources to capture (for example, `http_request_complete.v0` for HTTP traffic)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Destinations">
    Select and configure one or more destinations for your logs
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Supported destinations

ngrok supports exporting logs to:

- **Amazon CloudWatch** - AWS logging and monitoring
- **Amazon Firehose** - AWS data streaming (can deliver to S3)
- **Amazon Kinesis** - AWS data streaming
- **Azure Logs Ingestion** - Azure logging
- **Datadog Logs** - Monitoring and analytics

For detailed configuration of each destination type, see the [Log Exporting documentation](/obs/events).

## What logs include

Standard HTTP traffic logs from AI Gateway endpoints include:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `event_id` | Unique identifier for the log |
| `event_timestamp` | When the request completed |
| `account_id` | Your ngrok account ID |
| `conn.client_ip` | Client IP address |
| `conn.server_name` | Endpoint hostname |
| `http.request.method` | HTTP method (POST, GET, etc.) |
| `http.request.url.path` | Request path (for example, `/v1/chat/completions`) |
| `http.response.status_code` | Response status code |
| `http.response.body_length` | Response body size |

## What's not yet included

<Warning>
AI Gateway-specific data is **not** currently included in logs:

- Which provider handled the request
- Model selection strategy results  
- Retry attempts and failover decisions
- Token counts (input/output/total)
- Cost estimates
- Provider API key used

These AI-specific log fields are on our roadmap. Email [niji@ngrok.ai](mailto:niji@ngrok.ai) to tell us what data you need - your feedback shapes our development priorities.
</Warning>

## Filtering logs

You can filter traffic logs using CEL expressions to capture only relevant requests:

```cel
# Only log requests to chat completions endpoint
ev.http.request.url.path == "/v1/chat/completions"

# Only log errors
ev.http.response.status_code >= 400

# Only log slow requests (if timing fields available)
ev.http.response.status_code == 200
```

See the [Log Exporting documentation](/obs/events) for more filter examples.

## Use cases

### Compliance logging

Stream all requests to long-term storage for audit trails:
- Use Amazon Firehose to deliver to S3
- All HTTP requests are captured with timestamps and metadata
- Combine with Traffic Inspector for full body capture when needed

### Real-time monitoring

Send logs to your monitoring platform:
- Use Datadog or CloudWatch destinations
- Build dashboards showing request volume and latency
- Set up alerts for error spikes

### Custom analytics

Process logs in your own systems:
- Stream to Kinesis or Firehose
- Build custom pipelines for your specific needs
- Aggregate and analyze traffic patterns
