## Before you start

You'll need:
- An [ngrok account](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup)
- API keys from your AI providers (such as [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys), [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys), or [Google](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey))

<Steps>
  <Step title="Login to the ngrok Dashboard">
    Go to [dashboard.ngrok.com](https://dashboard.ngrok.com) and sign in to your account.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to AI Gateways">
    In the left sidebar, click on [**AI Gateways**](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/ai-gateways) under the Universal Gateway section.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a New AI Gateway">
    Click the **+ New AI Gateway** button to create your gateway.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter a URL">
    Enter a URL for your AI Gateway endpoint. If the domain is available, it will automatically be reserved for you. Click **Create & Configure** to finish setup.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Integrate with Your Application">
    Update your OpenAI SDK configuration to point to your new AI Gateway endpoint:

    ```js
    const openai = new OpenAI({
      baseURL: "https://your-ai-gateway.ngrok.dev",
      apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
    });
    ```

    Then use your SDK as normal:

    ```js
    const res = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: "gpt-4o",
      messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello, world!" }]
    });
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
