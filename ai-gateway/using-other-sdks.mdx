description: Use AI Gateway with any OpenAI-compatible SDK
---

The AI Gateway works with any **OpenAI-compatible** SDK, not just OpenAI's official libraries.

## Vercel AI SDK

The Vercel AI SDK provides a unified interface for multiple AI providers. Use AI Gateway with it:

```typescript
import { generateText } from "ai"
import { createOpenAI } from "@ai-sdk/openai"

const openai = createOpenAI({
  baseUrl: "https://ai-gateway.ngrok.app",
})

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
  prompt: "What is love?"
})
```

## LangChain

Configure LangChain to use your AI Gateway endpoint:

```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI(
    openai_api_base="https://ai-gateway.ngrok.app",
    openai_api_key="sk-..."
)

response = llm("Tell me a joke")
```

## Community SDKs

The AI Gateway is compatible with community-maintained OpenAI clients in various languages:

### Rust

```rust
use async_openai::{Client, config::OpenAIConfig};

let config = OpenAIConfig::new()
    .with_api_base("https://ai-gateway.ngrok.app");
let client = Client::with_config(config);
```

### Go

```go
package main

import "github.com/sashabaranov/go-openai"

func main() {
    config := openai.DefaultConfig("your-api-key")
    config.BaseURL = "https://ai-gateway.ngrok.app"
    client := openai.NewClientWithConfig(config)
}
```

### Java

```java
OpenAiService service = new OpenAiService("your-api-key");
service.setBaseUrl("https://ai-gateway.ngrok.app");
```

## Requirements

For a SDK to work with AI Gateway, it must:

1. Support OpenAI's API format
2. Allow customizing the base URL / endpoint
3. Send requests with proper `Authorization` headers

Most modern AI SDKs meet these requirements.

## What Gets Proxied?

When using AI Gateway with any SDK:

- All request headers are forwarded
- Request body is parsed for routing decisions
- Response is returned unchanged to your application
- Metrics are collected automatically

Your SDK's functionality remains fully intact - streaming, function calling, embeddings, etc., all work as expected.
