The ngrok AI Gateway sits between your application and AI providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.
It routes requests using your provider API keys, adding automatic failover, load balancing, and observability—without changing your code.

If one provider fails, it automatically tries another.
If one API key hits rate limits, it switches to the next.
You keep full control of your provider relationships and billing.

## Why use the AI Gateway?

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Failover & Routing" icon="rotate">
    Automatic retries on errors and timeouts. Customize the routing logic to prefer cheaper models, specific providers, or your own criteria.

## Quick example

Point your SDK at your [ngrok endpoint](/ai-gateway/guides/creating-endpoints):

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python (OpenAI) highlight={4}
  from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
base_url="https://your-ai-gateway.ngrok.app/v1",
api_key="your-api-key"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
model="gpt-4o",
messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)

````

```python Python (Anthropic) highlight={4}
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic(
base_url="https://your-ai-gateway.ngrok.app",
api_key="your-api-key"
)

message = client.messages.create(
model="claude-opus-4-5",
max_tokens=1024,
messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)
````

```typescript TypeScript (OpenAI) highlight={4}
import OpenAI from "openai";

const client = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: "https://your-ai-gateway.ngrok.app/v1",
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
});

const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4o",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello!" }],
});
```

```typescript TypeScript (Anthropic) highlight={4}
import Anthropic from "@anthropic-ai/sdk";

const client = new Anthropic({
  baseURL: "https://your-ai-gateway.ngrok.app",
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
});

const message = await client.messages.create({
  model: "claude-opus-4-5",
  max_tokens: 1024,
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello!" }],
});
```

```bash cURL (OpenAI) highlight={1}
curl https://your-ai-gateway.ngrok.app/v1/chat/completions \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key" \
-d '{
"model": "gpt-4o",
"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
}'
```

```bash cURL (Anthropic) highlight={1}
curl https://your-ai-gateway.ngrok.app/v1/messages \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "x-api-key: your-api-key" \
-H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
-d '{
"model": "claude-opus-4-5",
"max_tokens": 1024,
"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
}'
```
</CodeGroup>

Behind the scenes, the AI Gateway:

1. Receives your request
2. Selects which model and provider to use (based on request path and your configuration)
3. Forwards the request with the appropriate provider API key
4. If it fails, retries with the next option in your failover chain
5. Returns the response

## What can you do?

| Use Case | Description | | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | | **Multi-provider failover** | Configure OpenAI as primary, Anthropic as backup | | **Multi-key rotation** | Use multiple provider API keys to avoid rate limits | | **Custom selection strategies** | Define exactly how models are selected using CEL expressions | | **Cost-based routing** | Route to the cheapest available model automatically | | **Access control** | Restrict which providers and models clients can use | | **Self-hosted models** | Route to Ollama, vLLM, or other local inference servers | | **Content modification** | Redact PII, sanitize responses, or inject prompts |
