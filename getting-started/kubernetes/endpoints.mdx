import K8sSetup from "/snippets/k8s/_setup.mdx"; import K8sInstallBindings from "/snippets/k8s/_install-bindings.mdx";

This quickstart uses the [ngrok Kubernetes Operator](/k8s) and the ngrok agent to create a [Kubernetes-bound Endpoint](/universal-gateway/kubernetes-endpoints/), which is accessible to other pods in your cluster as a native Service. ngrok then handles all routing to the upstream service, which can be running anywhere, like your development laptop or a cloud-based developer environment.

When you use Kubernetes Endpoints, you can:

- View changes to your local services immediately by [projecting your local development environment](https://ngrok.com/blog-post/kubernetes-dev-loop-projection) into a remote development or staging cluster.
- Allow services in multiple clusters to communicate over a service mesh that doesn't require firewalls, VPNs, or port forwarding.
- Securely access your customer's APIs or databases (via [site-to-site connectivity](/guides/site-to-site-connectivity/)).
- Allow your Kubernetes-deployed services to call a webhook URL exposed with ngrok to speed up local development or CI jobs.

You also don't need to expose your local services to the public internet or modify the ingress rules to remote clusters.

<Note>
  The ngrok Kubernetes Operator is available to all ngrok users at no additional charge.
  You only incur costs if the resources provisioned by the controller incur a cost.
  Find more details on the [pricing page](https://ngrok.com/pricing), or, if you're a free user, the [free plan limits](/pricing-limits/free-plan-limits/).
</Note>

## What you'll need

- An ngrok account
- The [ngrok CLI](/getting-started/#2-install-the-ngrok-agent-cli) installed on your local machine
- A running K8s cluster with `kubectl` access with at least one service
  - If you don't have a cluster yet, see the [local cluster guide](/k8s/guides/local-cluster/) for some options
- [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/) and [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) 3.0.0 or later installed locally

## 1. Install the ngrok Kubernetes Operator

<K8sSetup />
<K8sInstallBindings />

## 2. Start an Agent Endpoint

On your local machine, start a new Agent Endpoint, replacing `$PORT` with the port your upstream service listens on.

```bash
ngrok http $PORT --url http://hello-world.default --binding kubernetes
```

The URL of a Kubernetes Endpoint has three parts, which determine how ngrok exposes it inside your cluster: the scheme (`http`, `tcp`, or `tls`), the service name, and the namespace.
In this example, ngrok provisions the `http://hello-world.default` URL into a Kubernetes service named `hello-world` in the `default` namespace.

Behind the scenes, your ngrok Kubernetes Operator continuously polls the ngrok API for new endpoints with the `kubernetes` binding.
When it detects your new `http://hello-world.default` endpoint, it provisions a `ClusterIP` Kubernetes service that routes directly to that endpoint.

<Tip>
You can also start agent-based Kubernetes Endpoints with:

- The [SDKs](/agent-sdks/)
- A second cluster
- Cloud Endpoints with the [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/endpoints)
- The [API](/api)

</Tip>

## 3. Add Traffic Policy to manipulate requests (optional)

Kubernetes Endpoints support the entire breadth of [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy), which lets you filter, manage, and orchestrate traffic as it passes between your local service and your cluster.

Because a Kubernetes Endpoint is only accessible inside of clusters where you've installed the ngrok Kubernetes Operator with your account's credentials, you don't need to add authentication.
Instead, you can add a header to your local service's response to demo how it works.

```yaml title="hello-world.yaml"
on_http_respons:
  - actions:
      - type: add-header
        config:
          headers:
            x-hello-world: Hello, world!
```

Run your Agent Endpoint again with the new Traffic Policy file.

```bash
ngrok http $PORT --url http://hello-world.default --binding kubernetes --traffic-policy-file hello-world.yaml
```

## 4. Start making requests

You can now access your non-Kubernetes service from within your cluster.
Test it out by running a temporary `curl` image on your cluster:

```bash
kubectl run -i --tty --rm debug --restart=Never --image=appropriate/curl -- /bin/sh
```

From within that new pod, `curl` your endpoint to get a response from your service.

```bash
curl -i http://hello-world.default
```

The `-i` flag outputs response headers, which will show any headers you added through your Traffic Policy.

## What's next?

First, read up on the rest of the Kubernetes Endpoints docs:

- [Kubernetes Endpoints](/universal-gateway/kubernetes-endpoints/)
- [Using Endpoint Bindings with the Operator](/k8s/guides/bindings/)

Ready to replace Telepresence with ngrok's Kubernetes Endpoints?
Read the [blog post](https://ngrok.com/blog-post/kubernetes-dev-loop-projection) on the process and _why_ it's easier for both platform engineers and API/app developers.

Kubernetes Endpoints also support [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy):

- [Traffic Policy overview](/traffic-policy)
- [Traffic Policy concepts](/traffic-policy/concepts/)
- All [available actions](/traffic-policy/actions/), including a few most relevant to these types of endpoints:
  - [`add-headers`](/traffic-policy/actions/add-headers/)
  - [`rate-limit`](/traffic-policy/actions/rate-limit/)
  - [`verify-webhook`](/traffic-policy/actions/verify-webhook/)

Finally, explore the [Traffic Inspector in your dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/traffic-inspector) for real-time observability of traffic flowing through your endpoint.
