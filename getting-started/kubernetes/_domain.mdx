Head over to the [**Domains** section](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains) and click **+ New Domain** to grab a new domain.
You can choose between a domain with an ngrok-branded TLD like `.ngrok.app` or `.ngrok.io`, or you can [bring a custom domain](/universal-gateway/custom-domains/).

This guide refers to this as `$YOUR_DOMAIN` from here on out.
