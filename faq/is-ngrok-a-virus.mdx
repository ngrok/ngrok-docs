title: Is ngrok a virus?
description: ngrok is legitimate developer tooling, not malware. Learn why antivirus software sometimes flags it and how to verify you have the real ngrok.

No.
ngrok is not a virus.
It is legitimate developer tooling.

Because ngrok is easy to use and powerful, attackers sometimes use it for phishing or back doors.
Some antivirus products therefore flag it as malware or a potentially unwanted application (PUA).
ngrok monitors for abuse, bans abusive accounts, and works with antivirus vendors to correct classifications.
Report abuse to [abuse@ngrok.com](mailto:abuse@ngrok.com) or the [abuse APIs](/api-reference/abusereports/create).

If your antivirus flags ngrok, confirm:

- You downloaded from the [ngrok Downloads](https://ngrok.com/downloads) page.
  Other sources may be unsafe.
- You did not build from "source."
  There is no open source ngrok agent; source code is not public.
  Anything claiming to be ngrok source or "build from source" is likely malicious.
- The binary is signed by ngrok LLC or ngrok, Inc.
  On Windows, see [Microsoft's instructions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/view-digital-signature-and-certificate-details-76ba00cb-1e58-42aa-8717-0caee76bb3cf).

Reporting ngrok helps correct classifications.
