No, ngrok is not a virus—it is legitimate developer tooling.

ngrok is popular for its ease of use and capability.
Unfortunately, those same qualities make it attractive to bad actors who use tunneling tools for phishing or back doors into private networks.
When antivirus vendors see ngrok in that context, some flag it as malware or a potentially unwanted application (PUA).
ngrok monitors for abuse, bans accounts involved in attacks, and works with vendors to get the correct classification and onto allow lists.
You can report abuse to [abuse@ngrok.com](mailto:abuse@ngrok.com) or the [abuse APIs](/api-reference/abusereports/create).

If your antivirus flags ngrok when you install it, the warning is often a false positive.
Before trusting the install, be sure to verify the following:

- You downloaded from the [ngrok Downloads](https://ngrok.com/download) page; binaries are hosted at `bin.equinox.io`.
  If you got ngrok from somewhere else, be careful.
- You did not build from "source."
  There is no open source ngrok agent and the source code is not public.
  Anything claiming to be ngrok source code or instructions to "build from source" is likely malicious.
- The binary is signed by ngrok LLC or ngrok, Inc.
  You can verify the signature; on Windows, see [Microsoft's instructions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/view-digital-signature-and-certificate-details-76ba00cb-1e58-42aa-8717-0caee76bb3cf).
  Binary hashes for every release are available at [dl.equinox.io/ngrok/ngrok-v3/stable/archive](https://dl.equinox.io/ngrok/ngrok-v3/stable/archive).

## What is bin.equinox.io?

Equinox is fully owned by ngrok. 
If you visit [equinox.io](https://equinox.io) you'll see it redirect to [ngrok.com/download](https://ngrok.com/download).
No other software is distributed via Equinox.

If you're confident you have the official binary, you can add an exception in your antivirus or report it as a false positive.
Most antivirus products have an option for that in the app or on their support site.
[VirusTotal lists contacts](https://docs.virustotal.com/docs/false-positive-contacts) for reporting false positives to many vendors.
Reporting ngrok there helps get the correct classification in their systems.
