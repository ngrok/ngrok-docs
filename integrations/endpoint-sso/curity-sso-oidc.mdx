<Disclaimer />

This guide walks you through configuring Curity as the primary Identity Provider for ngrok tunnels using single sign-on (SSO).
By integrating Curity Identity Server with ngrok, you can:

- Restrict access to ngrok tunnels to only users who authenticated via Curity
- Use Curity security policies, MFA authenticators—including BankId, SITHS, and WebAuthn—to control access to ngrok tunnels
- Use Curity's Dashboard to facilitate access to ngrok apps

## What you'll need

- A Curity account with administrative rights to create clients.
- An ngrok Enterprise account with an authtoken or admin access to configure edges with OpenID Connect.

## 1. Configure Curity Authentication

The Curity Identity Server provides an authenticator called `html-form` that is suitable for setting up a login with username and password.
It uses a Credential Manager to verify the credentials, which in turn uses a data-source.
There are many options for stronger authentication than username and password; Curity documents possible authentication methods.

### Add authentication

- #### Add an Authenticator
  - Navigate to Profiles > Authentication Service > Authenticators.
  - Click **New Authenticator** on the authenticator page and give it a name.
  - Select the `HTML-Form` Authenticator type in the grid of authenticators and click **Next**.
  - Under **HTML Form Settings**, select the `default-account-manager` as account manager and `default-credential-manager` as credential manager.

- #### Commit the changes
  - Commit the changes via the **Changes** menu.

## 2. Configure Curity for OIDC

### Add an openid client in Curity

- #### Add New Client
  - Navigate to **Profiles** > **Token Service** > **Clients** and click **+ New Client**.
  - Give the client an ID (for example,  `www` for a website client) and click **Create**.

- #### Add Capabilities
  - Scroll down to the **Capabilities** section and click **Add capabilities**.
  - Select the **Code Flow** capability and click **Next**.

  - Enter `http://localhost/callback` as a **Redirect URI** and click **Add**.
  - Click **Next**.
  - On the **Client Authentication** screen, select **secret**.
  - Click **Generate** to generate a new secret.
  - Copy the **secret** since it cannot be retrieved later again (but can be reset).
  - On the **User Authentication** screen, select the `HTML-form` authenticator created in **[Step 1](#1-configure-curity-authentication)**.
  - Click **Done**.
  - Scroll down on the newly created client page to **Scopes and Claims**.
  - Select `openid` from the list of scopes in the dropdown menu.

- #### Expose the metadata url

  ngrok makes a call to the `/.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint at Curity to pull configuration data specific to your Authorization Server.
  - Navigate to **Profiles** > **Token Service** > **General** page.
  - Scroll down to the **OpenID Connect** section and enable the `Expose Metadata` toggle.

- #### Commit the changes
  - Commit the changes via the **Changes** menu.

## 3. Configure ngrok

ngrok can use Curity Identity Server in two ways:

- From the ngrok CLI (using the `--oidc` parameter)
- From the ngrok dashboard

### **Option 1**: ngrok CLI

<Note>  This tutorial assumes you have an app running locally (for example, on `localhost:3000`) with the ngrok client installed.
</Note>

- Launch a terminal.
- Enter the following command to launch an ngrok tunnel with Curity Identity Server.
  Replace `<curity_url>` with your Curity issuer address (for example, `https://acme.com/oauth/v2/oauth-anonymous`) and the `<curity_client_id>` and `<curity_client_secret>` with the respective values copied from the ngrok app registered at Curity:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000 --oidc <curity_url> \
  --oidc-client-id <curity_client_id> \
  --oidc-client-secret <curity_client_secret> \
  --url curity-sso-test.ngrok.dev
  ```

- Skip to **Step 4** to test the integration.

### **Option 2**: ngrok edge

To configure an edge with Curity:

- Go to your [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com).
- Click **Universal Gateway > Edges**.
- If you don't have an edge already set to add Curity Identity Server, create a test edge:
  - Click **New Edge**.
  - Click **HTTPS Edge**.
  - Click the **pencil icon** next to "no description".
    Enter `Edge with Curity Identity Server` as the edge name and click **Save**.
- On the edge settings, click **OIDC**.
- Click **Begin setup** and enter the following:
  - **Issuer URL**: Your Curity issuer URL (for example, `https://acme.com/oauth/v2/oauth-anonymous`).
  - **Client ID**: The name of the client from Curity.
  - **Client Secret**: The client secret copied from Curity.
- Click **Save**.
- Launch a tunnel connected to your Curity edge:

<Note>  This step assumes you have an app running locally (for example, on `localhost:3000`) with the ngrok client installed.
</Note>

- Click **Start a tunnel**.
- Click the **copy icon** next to the tunnel command.
- Launch a tunnel:
  - Launch a terminal.
  - Paste the command.
    Replace `http://localhost:80` with your local web app address (for example, `http://localhost:3000`).
  - Press **Enter**.
    An ngrok tunnel associated with your edge configuration will launch.
- To confirm that the tunnel is connected to your edge:
  - Return to the ngrok dashboard.
  - Close the **Start a tunnel** and the **Tunnel group** tabs.
  - Refresh the test edge page.
    Under traffic, you will see the message _You have 1 tunnel online. Start additional tunnels to begin load balancing_.
- In the test edge, copy the **endpoint URL**.
  You will use this URL to test the Curity authentication.

## 4. Test the integration

- In your browser, launch an incognito window.
- Access your ngrok tunnel (for example, `https://curity-sso-test.ngrok.app` or using a copied URL).
- You should be prompted to log in with your Curity credentials.
- After logging in, you should be able to see your web app.
