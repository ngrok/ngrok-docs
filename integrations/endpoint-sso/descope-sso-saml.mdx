<Disclaimer />

This guide walks you through configuring Descope as the primary Identity Provider for ngrok endpoints using single sign-on (SSO).
By integrating Descope SSO with ngrok, you can:

- Restrict access to ngrok endpoints only to users authenticated via Descope
- Use Descope security policies and MFA authenticators
- Use the Descope Console to facilitate access to ngrok apps

The ngrok integration with Descope supports SP-Initiated SSO.
In this mode, users access ngrok edges and tunnels and are redirected to Descope for authentication.

## What you'll need

- A Descope project with administrative rights and an Enterprise license to be able to create SAML applications.
- An ngrok Enterprise account with an authtoken or admin access to configure edges with SAML.

## 1. Fetch IdP Metadata

### Add the ngrok app in Descope

- Open the Descope Console.
- On the left menu, click **Applications**, and then click **+ Application** in the top right corner.
- In the popup window, enter `ngrok` in the **Name** field, make sure that `SAML` is selected under **Authentication protocol**, and then click **Create**.
- On the **ngrok** application page, click the download button next to **Descope Metadata (XML)** to download the Metadata file that you'll need later on.
  Make sure to leave this page open.
- **Optional**: If you wish to change the Auth Hosting URL to use a different flow for ngrok SSO, you can change that on this page, and click **Save**.

## 2. Configure ngrok

To configure an edge with Descope:

- Access the [ngrok Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/) and sign in using your ngrok account.
- On the left menu, click **Universal Gateway** and then click **Edges**.
- If you don't have an edge already set to add Descope SSO, create a test edge:
  - Click **+ New Edge**.
  - Click **Create HTTPS Edge**.
  - Click the **pencil icon** next to "no description", enter `Descope SSO SAML` as the edge name, and click **Save**.
- On the edge settings menu, click **SAML**.
- On the **SAML** page, click **Begin setup**, click **Upload XML**, and then open the XML metadata file you downloaded from Descope (See [Fetch IdP Metadata](#1-fetch-idp-metadata)).
- **Optional**: If you wish to enable IdP-initiated SSO, so that you can sign in directly from the Descope IdP-initiated SSO URL instead of from ngrok, you can check this box.
- Click **Save** at the top.
- Copy both the **Entity ID** and the **ACS URL** values for later use.

## 3. Configure Descope

- Back in the Descope Console, under your **ngrok** application, select **Enter the connection details manually** under **Service Provider (SP)**.
- Enter the following values in the input fields and save the configuration.

  Replace the following with the values copied on previous steps:
  - `NGROK_ACS_URL`: The value of the ngrok **Entity ID** copied from the edge SAML configuration.
  - `NGROK_ENTITY_ID_URL`: The value of the ngrok **ACS URL** copied from the edge SAML configuration.

## 4. Start a tunnel

- Access the [ngrok edges page](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/edges), click your edge, and then click **Start a tunnel**.

<Tip>  This step assumes you have an app running locally (for example, on `localhost:3000`) with the ngrok client installed.
  
</Tip>

- Click the **copy icon** next to the tunnel command.
- Launch a tunnel:
  - Launch a terminal.
  - Paste the command but replace `http://localhost:80` with your localhost app address (such as `http://localhost:3000`).
  - Press **Enter** and an ngrok tunnel associated with your edge configuration will launch.
- To confirm that the tunnel is connected to your edge:
  - Return to the ngrok dashboard.
  - Close the **Start a tunnel** and the **Tunnel group** tabs.
  - Refresh the test edge page.
    Under traffic, you will see the message _You have 1 tunnel online. Start additional tunnels to begin load balancing_.
- In the test edge, copy the **endpoint URL**.
  You use this URL to test the Descope authentication.

## 5. Test the integration

- In your browser, launch an incognito window.
- Access your ngrok endpoint (for example, `https://descope-sso-test.ngrok.app` or use the copied URL).
- You should be prompted to log in with Descope.
- After logging in, you should be able to see your web app.
