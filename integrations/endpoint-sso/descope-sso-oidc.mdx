This guide explains how to configure Descope as the primary Identity Provider for your ngrok endpoints using single sign-on (SSO).
By integrating Descope SSO with ngrok, you can:

- Restrict access to ngrok endpoints only to users authenticated via Descope
- Use Descope security policies and MFA authenticators
- Use the Descope Console to facilitate access to ngrok apps

The ngrok integration with Descope supports SP-Initiated SSO.
In this mode, users access ngrok endpoints and are redirected to Descope for authentication.

## What you'll need

- A Descope account with administrative rights to a Descope Project.
- An ngrok Enterprise account with an authtoken or admin access to configure edges with OpenID Connect.

## 1. Configure Descope 

### Add the ngrok app in Descope

- Open the Descope Console.
- On the left menu, click **Applications**, and then click **+ Application** in the top right corner.
- In the popup window, enter `ngrok` in the **Name** field, make sure that `OIDC` is selected under **Authentication protocol**, and then click **Create**.
- On the **ngrok** application page, make a note of the **Issuer** URL.
- **Optional**: If you wish to change the Auth Hosting URL to use a different flow for ngrok SSO, you can change that on this page, and click **Save**.

### Create a client secret in Descope

- Go to **Access Keys** in the Descope Console.
- Click **+ Access Key** in the top right corner.
- In the popup window, enter `ngrok` in the **Name** field, change the **Expiration** time to whatever you prefer, and then click **Generate Key**.
- Once the **Access Key** has been created, make a note of it for later.

## 2. Configure ngrok 

ngrok can use Descope SSO in two ways:

- From the ngrok CLI (using the `--oidc` parameter)
- From the ngrok dashboard

### **Option 1**: ngrok CLI

<Note>
This tutorial assumes you have an app running locally (for example, on `localhost:3000`) with the ngrok client installed.
</Note>

- Launch a terminal.
- Enter the following command to launch an ngrok tunnel with Descope SSO:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000 --oidc=DESCOPE_ISSUER_URL \
  --oidc-client-id=DESCOPE_CLIENT_ID \
  --oidc-client-secret=DESCOPE_CLIENT_SECRET \
  ```

  Replace the following with values:
  - `DESCOPE_ISSUER_URL`: This is your Issuer URL that you copied from the **Applications** page earlier.
  - `DESCOPE_CLIENT_ID`: This is your Descope Project ID, which can be found under **Project Settings** in the Descope Console.
  - `DESCOPE_CLIENT_SECRET`: This is the Descope Access Key that you created from earlier.

  Alternatively, add the `--url YOUR_DOMAIN` argument to get your custom URL, replacing `YOUR_DOMAIN` with your URL of preference.
- Copy the URL available next to **Forwarding** (for example, `https://descope-sso-test.ngrok.app`).
- Skip to **Step 3**.

### **Option 2**: ngrok edge

To configure an edge with Descope:

- Access the [ngrok Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/) and sign in using your ngrok account.
- On the left menu, click **Universal Gateway** and then click **Edges**.
- If you don't have an edge already set to add Descope SSO, create a test edge:
  - Click **+ New Edge**.
  - Click **Create HTTPS Edge**.
  - Click the **pencil icon** next to "no description", enter `Edge with Descope SSO OIDC` as the edge name, and click **Save**.
- On the edge settings menu, click **OIDC**.
- Click **Begin setup** and enter the following values into the fields:
  - **Issuer URL**: This is your Issuer URL that you copied from the **Applications** page earlier.
  - **Client ID**: The client ID you copied from Descope.
  - **Client Secret**: The client secret you copied from Descope.
- Click **Save** at the top, and then click the left arrow to go back to the **Edges** page.
- Launch a tunnel connected to your Descope edge:

  <Note>
  This step assumes you have an app running locally (for example, on `localhost:3000`) with the ngrok client installed.
  </Note>

- Click **Start a tunnel**.
- Click the **copy icon** next to the tunnel command.
- Launch a tunnel:
  - Launch a terminal.
  - Paste the command but replace `http://localhost:80` with your localhost app address (such as `http://localhost:3000`).
  - Press **Enter** and an ngrok tunnel associated with your edge configuration will launch.
- To confirm that the tunnel is connected to your edge:
  - Return to the ngrok dashboard.
  - Close the **Start a tunnel** and the **Tunnel group** tabs.
  - Refresh the test edge page.
  Under traffic, you will see the message _You have 1 tunnel online. Start additional tunnels to begin load balancing_.
- In the test edge, copy the **endpoint URL**.
You use this URL to test the Descope authentication.

## 3. Test the integration

- In your browser, launch an incognito window.
- Access your ngrok endpoint (for example, `https://descope-sso-test.ngrok.app` or using the copied URL).
- You should be prompted to log in with Descope.
- After logging in, you should be able to see your web app.
