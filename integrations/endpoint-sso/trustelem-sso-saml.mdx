<Disclaimer />

This guide walks you through configuring Wallix Trustelem as the primary Identity Provider for ngrok tunnels using single sign-on (SSO).
By integrating Wallix Trustelem SSO with ngrok, you can:

- Restrict access to ngrok tunnels only to users authenticated via Wallix Trustelem
- Use Wallix Trustelem security policies and MFA authenticators
- Use Wallix Trustelem's Dashboard to facilitate access to ngrok apps

## What you'll need

- A Wallix Trustelem account with administrative rights to create apps.
- An ngrok Enterprise account with an authtoken or admin access to configure edges with SAML.

## 1. Configure Wallix Trustelem

- Access the WALLIX Trustelem administration console and sign in using your Trustelem account.
- On the **Dashboard** page, click **Apps** on the left menu, click **Add an application** and click the **SAML 2 application** tile in the **Generic models** section.
- On the **Settings** popup, enter `ngrok saml` in the **Name** field, click **Save**, click **Download metadata files**, save the XML file on your desktop, and then click **Close**.

## 2. Configure ngrok

To configure an edge with Wallix Trustelem:

- Access the [ngrok Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/) and sign in using your ngrok account.
- On the left menu, click **Universal Gateway** and then click **Edges**.
- If you don't have an edge already set to add Wallix Trustelem SSO, create a test edge:
  - Click **+ New Edge**.
  - Click **Create HTTPS Edge**.
  - Click the **pencil icon** next to "no description", enter `Edge with Trustelem SSO SAML` as the edge name, and click **Save**.
- On the edge settings menu, click **SAML**.
- On the **SAML** page, click **Begin setup**, click **Upload XML**, and then open the XML metadata file you downloaded from Wallix Trustelem (See [Configure Wallix Trustelem](#1-configure-wallix-trustelem)).
- Click **Save** at the top.
- On the **SAML** page of your [ngrok edge](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/edges), make note of the URL of both the **Entity ID** and **ACS URL** fields.

## 3. Link Wallix Trustelem with ngrok

- On the WALLIX Trustelem administration console, click **Apps** on the left menu, and then click your application.
- On the **Settings** popup, click **Edit**, paste the **Entity ID** URL in the **EntityID** field and the **ACS URL** URL in the **Assertion Consumer Service** field.
  You copied both URLs from the previous step.
- Click **Save**.

## 4. Start a tunnel

- Access the [ngrok edges page](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/edges), click your edge, and then click **Start a tunnel**.

<Note>
    This step assumes you have an app running locally (for example, on `localhost:3000`) with the ngrok client installed.

</Note>

- Click the **copy icon** next to the tunnel command.
- Launch a tunnel:
  - Launch a terminal.
  - Paste the command but replace `http://localhost:80` with your localhost app address (such as `http://localhost:3000`).
  - Press **Enter** and an ngrok tunnel associated with your edge configuration will launch.
- To confirm that the tunnel is connected to your edge:
  - Return to the ngrok dashboard.
  - Close the **Start a tunnel** and the **Tunnel group** tabs.
  - Refresh the test edge page.
    Under traffic, you will see the message _You have 1 tunnel online. Start additional tunnels to begin load balancing_.
- In the test edge, copy the **endpoint URL**.
  You use this URL to test the Wallix Trustelem authentication.

## Grant access to Wallix Trustelem users

Wallix Trustelem allows their users to access SAML-integrated apps.
To create a user, follow the instructions below:

- On the left menu of the WALLIX Trustelem administration console, click **Users** and then click **Create User**.
- Enter values for **First Name**, **Last Name**, and **Primary Email** fields, and then click **Save**.

## Test the integration

- In your browser, launch an incognito window.
- Access your ngrok tunnel (for example, `https://trustelem-sso-test.ngrok.app` or using the copied endpoint URL).
- You should be prompted to log in with your Wallix Trustelem credentials.
- After logging in, you should be able to see your web app.
