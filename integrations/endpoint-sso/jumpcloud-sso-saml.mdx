<Disclaimer />

This guide walks you through configuring JumpCloud as the primary Identity Provider for ngrok tunnels using single sign-on (SSO).
By integrating JumpCloud SSO with ngrok, you can:

- Restrict access to ngrok tunnels only to users authenticated via JumpCloud
- Use JumpCloud security policies and MFA authenticators
- Use JumpCloud's Dashboard to facilitate access to ngrok apps

## What you'll need

- A JumpCloud account with administrative rights to create apps.
- An ngrok Enterprise account with an authtoken or admin access to configure edges with SAML.

## 1. Configure JumpCloud

- Access the JumpCloud Console and sign in using your JumpCloud administrator account.
- On the left menu, click **SSO**, click **Get Started** or **+ Add New Application**, and then click **Custom SAML App**.
- On the **New Application** popup, enter `ngrok saml` in the **Display Label** field.
- Click the **SSO** tab, enter `https://ngrok-jumpcloud` in the **IdP Entity ID** field, enter temporary values (such as `https://temporary`) in both the **SP Entity ID** and the **ACS URL** fields, and then click **Activate**.

## 2. Download the IdP metadata

- On the **SSO** page of the JumpCloud Console, click your **Custom SAML App**, click the **SSO** tab, click **Export Metadata**, and then save the XML file on your desktop.

## 3. Configure ngrok

To configure an edge with JumpCloud:

- Access the [ngrok Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/) and sign in using your ngrok account.
- On the left menu, click **Universal Gateway** and then click **Edges**.
- If you don't have an edge already set to add JumpCloud SSO, create a test edge:
  - Click **+ New Edge**.
  - Click **Create HTTPS Edge**.
  - Click the **pencil icon** next to "no description", enter `Edge with JumpCloud SSO SAML` as the edge name, and click **Save**.
- On the edge settings menu, click **SAML**.
- On the **SAML** page, click **Begin setup**, click **Upload XML**, and then open the XML metadata file you downloaded from JumpCloud (See [Download the IdP metadata](#2-download-the-idp-metadata)).
- Click **Save** at the top.

## 4. Download the SP metadata

- On the **SAML** page of your [ngrok edge](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/edges), click the three dots close to the **SP Metadata** field, click **Download XML File**, and then save the XML file on your desktop.

## 5. Link JumpCloud with ngrok

- Access the JumpCloud Console, click **SSO**, click your **Custom SAML App**, click the **SSO** tab, click **Upload Metadata**, and then open the XML metadata file you downloaded from ngrok (See [Download the SP metadata](#4-download-the-sp-metadata)).
- Click **Save**.

## 6. Start a tunnel

- Access the [ngrok edges page](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/edges), click your edge, and then click **Start a tunnel**.

<Note>
    This step assumes you have an app running locally (for example, on `localhost:3000`) with the ngrok client installed.
</Note>

- Click the **copy icon** next to the tunnel command.
- Launch a tunnel:
  - Launch a terminal.
  - Paste the command but replace `http://localhost:80` with your localhost app address (such as `http://localhost:3000`).
  - Press **Enter** and an ngrok tunnel associated with your edge configuration will launch.
- To confirm that the tunnel is connected to your edge:
  - Return to the ngrok dashboard.
  - Close the **Start a tunnel** and the **Tunnel group** tabs.
  - Refresh the test edge page.
    Under traffic, you will see the message _You have 1 tunnel online. Start additional tunnels to begin load balancing_.
- In the test edge, copy the **endpoint URL**.
  You use this URL to test the JumpCloud authentication.

## Grant access to JumpCloud users

JumpCloud allows administrators to restrict access to SSO apps—such as ngrok—via user group assignments.
By default, apps created in JumpCloud have no group assignments; in other words, nobody can use JumpCloud SSO to access ngrok until you assign a group to the app.
To assign JumpCloud groups to the ngrok app:

- On the left menu of the JumpCloud Console, click **SSO** and click the ngrok custom SAML app you created.
- On the app popup, click the **User Groups** tab, click the checkbox of the **All Users** group, and then click **Save**.
  Make sure to add JumpCloud users to this group when you create or manage users that need access to the ngrok app.

## Test the integration

- In your browser, launch an incognito window.
- Access your ngrok tunnel (for example, `https://jumpcloud-sso-test.ngrok.app` or using the copied endpoint URL).
- You should be prompted to log in with your JumpCloud credentials.
- After logging in, you should be able to see your web app.
