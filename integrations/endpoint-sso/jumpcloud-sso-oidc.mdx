**TL;DR**



To secure access to ngrok with JumpCloud single sign-on (SSO) using OpenID Connect:

1. [Configure JumpCloud SSO](#configure-jumpcloud)
2. [Configure ngrok](#configure-ngrok)
3. [Test access to ngrok with JumpCloud SSO](#test-sso)
</Tip>

This guide explains how to configure JumpCloud as the primary Identity Provider for ngrok tunnels using single sign-on (SSO).
By integrating JumpCloud SSO with ngrok, you can:

- Restrict access to ngrok tunnels only to users authenticated via JumpCloud
- Use JumpCloud security policies and MFA authenticators
- Use JumpCloud's Dashboard to facilitate access to ngrok apps

The ngrok integration with JumpCloud supports SP-Initiated SSO.
In this mode, users access ngrok edges and tunnels and are redirected to JumpCloud for authentication.

## What you'll need

- A JumpCloud account with administrative rights to create apps.
- An ngrok Enterprise account with an authtoken or admin access to configure edges with OpenID Connect.

## 1. Configure JumpCloud 

### Add the ngrok app in JumpCloud

1. Access the [JumpCloud Console](https://console.jumpcloud.com/) and sign in using your JumpCloud administrator account.
2. On the left menu, click **SSO**, click **Get Started** or **+ Add New Application**, and then click **Custom OIDC App**.
3. On the **New Application** popup, enter `ngrok oidc` in the **Display Label** field.
4. Click the **SSO** tab, enter `https://idp.ngrok.com/oauth2/callback` in the **Redirect URIs** field, select **Client Secret Basic** as the **Client Authentication Type**, and enter the URL provided by the ngrok agent to expose your application to the internet in the **Login URL** (for example, `https://myexample.ngrok.app`).
5. Click **Activate**.
6. On the **Application Saved** popup, copy the value of both the **Client ID** and the **Client Secret** fields, and then click **Got It**.

### Grant access to JumpCloud users

JumpCloud allows administrators to restrict access to SSO apps—such as ngrok—via user group assignments.
By default, apps created in JumpCloud have no group assignments; in other words, nobody can use JumpCloud SSO to access ngrok until you assign a group to the app.
To assign JumpCloud groups to the ngrok app:

1. On the left menu of the [JumpCloud Console](https://console.jumpcloud.com/), click **SSO** and click the ngrok custom OIDC app you created.
2. On the app popup, click the **User Groups** tab, click the checkbox of the **All Users** group, and then click **Save**.
Make sure to add JumpCloud users to this group when you create or manage users that need access to the ngrok app.

## 2. Configure ngrok 

ngrok can use JumpCloud SSO in two ways:

- From the ngrok CLI (using the `--oidc` parameter)
- From the ngrok dashboard

### **Option 1**: ngrok CLI

<Note>
This tutorial assumes you have an app running locally (for example, on `localhost:3000`) with the ngrok client installed.
</Note>

1. Launch a terminal.
2. Enter the following command to launch an ngrok tunnel with JumpCloud SSO:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000 --oidc=JUMPCLOUD_OAUTH_URL \
   --oidc-client-id=JUMPCLOUD_CLIENT_ID \
   --oidc-client-secret=JUMPCLOUD_CLIENT_SECRET \
   ```

   Replace the following with values:
   - JUMPCLOUD_OAUTH_URL: Your JumpCloud OIDC base URL (for example, `https://oauth.id.jumpcloud.com/`).
   - JUMPCLOUD_CLIENT_ID: The client ID you copied from JumpCloud.
   - JUMPCLOUD_CLIENT_SECRET: The client secret you copied from JumpCloud.

   Alternatively, add the `--url YOUR_DOMAIN` argument to get your custom URL, replacing `YOUR_DOMAIN` with your URL of preference.
3. Copy the URL available next to **Forwarding** (for example, `https://jumpcloud-sso-test.ngrok.app`).
4. Skip to **Step 3**.

### **Option 2**: ngrok edge

To configure an edge with JumpCloud:

1. Access the [ngrok Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/) and sign in using your ngrok account.
2. On the left menu, click **Universal Gateway** and then click **Edges**.
3. If you don't have an edge already set to add JumpCloud SSO, create a test edge:
   - Click **+ New Edge**.
   - Click **Create HTTPS Edge**.
   - Click the **pencil icon** next to "no description", enter `Edge with JumpCloud SSO OIDC` as the edge name and click **Save**.
4. On the edge settings menu, click **OIDC**.
5. Click **Begin setup** and enter the following values into the fields:
   - **Issuer URL**: Your JumpCloud OIDC base URL (for example, `https://oauth.id.jumpcloud.com/`).
   - **Client ID**: The client ID you copied from JumpCloud.
   - **Client Secret**: The client secret you copied from JumpCloud.
6. Click **Save** at the top, and then click the left arrow to go back to the **Edges** page.
7. Launch a tunnel connected to your JumpCloud edge:

   <Note>
   This step assumes you have an app running locally (for example, on `localhost:3000`) with the ngrok client installed.
   </Note>

8. Click **Start a tunnel**.
9. Click the **copy icon** next to the tunnel command.
10. Launch a tunnel:
    - Launch a terminal.
    - Paste the command but replace `http://localhost:80` with your localhost app address (such as `http://localhost:3000`).
    - Press **Enter** and an ngrok tunnel associated with your edge configuration will launch.
11. To confirm that the tunnel is connected to your edge:
    - Return to the ngrok dashboard.
    - Close the **Start a tunnel** and the **Tunnel group** tabs.
    - Refresh the test edge page.
    Under traffic, you will see the message _You have 1 tunnel online. Start additional tunnels to begin load balancing_.
12. In the test edge, copy the **endpoint URL**.
You use this URL to test the JumpCloud authentication.

## 3. Test the integration

1. In your browser, launch an incognito window.
2. Access your ngrok tunnel (for example, `https://jumpcloud-sso-test.ngrok.app` or using the copied endpoint URL).
3. You should be prompted to log in with your JumpCloud credentials.
4. After logging in, you should be able to see your web app.
