**TL;DR**



To secure access to ngrok Dashboard using Microsoft Entra ID Single Sign-On with SAML:

1. [Configure Microsoft Entra ID SSO](#configure-entra)

</Tip>

This article details how to configure Microsoft Entra ID as the primary Identity Provider for the ngrok Dashboard.
By integrating Microsoft Entra ID SSO with ngrok, you can:

- **Restrict access to the ngrok Dashboard** only to users authenticated via Microsoft Entra ID
- **Use Microsoft Entra ID's Dashboard to facilitate access to the ngrok app**.

## Requirements

To configure the ngrok Dashboard with Microsoft Entra ID, you must have:

- an ngrok account with administrative rights to modify the account settings
- an [ngrok Account](https://ngrok.com/pricing) with access to configure SAML SSO.

## Configuration steps

To integrate ngrok with Microsoft Entra ID SSO, you will need to:

1. Configure Microsoft Entra ID with the ngrok app
1. Configure ngrok with the SSO settings provided by Microsoft Entra ID

## 1. Configure Microsoft Entra ID 

### Create the ngrok app in Microsoft Entra ID

1. Access your Microsoft Entra ID Dashboard as an administrator.
1. Click **Enterprise Applications**.
1. Click **New application** > **Create your own application**.
1. Provide a name for the app (for example, ngrok Dashboard) and choose the **Non-gallery** option and click **Create**.
1. Select **Single sign-on**, and then choose **SAML**.
1. Enter in temporary values for "Identifier" and "Reply URL" and modify the value of "Unique User Identifier" to equal "user.mail".

### Download the IdP metadata

1. From within the **Single sign-on** section on the ngrok Dashboard app, click the **Download** option for **Federation Metadata XML**. Download the metadata XML.

### Grant access to users and groups

Microsoft Entra ID allows administrators to restrict access to SSO apps—such as the ngrok Dashboard—via assignments. By default, apps created in Microsoft Entra ID have no assignments; in other words, nobody can use Microsoft Entra ID SSO to access the ngrok Dashboard until you assign them to the app. To assign users and groups to the ngrok Dashboard app:

1. Navigate to the **User and groups** from within the application.
1. Use the **Add user/group** button to associate groups and users with the ngrok app. **To test the SSO with ngrok, make sure you're assigned to the app**.

## 2. Configure ngrok
