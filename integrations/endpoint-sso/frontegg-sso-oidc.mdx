<Tip>
**TL;DR**

To secure access to ngrok with Frontegg single sign-on (SSO) using OpenID Connect:

1. [Configure Frontegg SSO](#configure-frontegg)
2. [Configure ngrok](#configure-ngrok)
3. [Test access to ngrok with Frontegg SSO](#test-sso)
</Tip>

This guide walks you through configuring Frontegg as the primary Identity Provider (IDP) for ngrok endpoints using single sign-on (SSO).
By integrating Frontegg SSO with ngrok, you can:

- Restrict access to ngrok endpoints only to users authenticated via Frontegg
- Use Frontegg security policies and MFA authenticators
- Use Frontegg's Dashboard to facilitate access to ngrok apps

The ngrok integration with Frontegg supports SP-Initiated SSO.
In this mode, users access ngrok endpoints and are redirected to Frontegg for authentication.

## What you'll need

- A Frontegg account with administrative rights to create apps.
- An ngrok Enterprise account with an authtoken or admin access to configure edges with OpenID Connect.

## 1. Configure Frontegg 

### Add the ngrok app in Frontegg

1. Access the [Frontegg Portal](https://portal.frontegg.com/) and sign in using your Frontegg administrator account.
2. On the left menu, click the environment you want to integrate with ngrok.
In this example, click the **Development** environment.
3. On the left menu, click **Authentication**, click **Login method**, enter the URL `https://idp.ngrok.com/oauth2/callback` under the **Hosted login** field, and then click **Save**.
4. On the left menu, click **Env settings**, and copy the value of both the **Client ID** and the **API key** fields.
5. Click the **Domains** tab, and copy the value of the **Domain name**.

### Grant access to Frontegg users

Create a Frontegg user:

1. On the left menu of the [Frontegg Portal](https://portal.frontegg.com/), click your environment, click **Backoffice**, click **Accounts**, and then click **Add New**.
2. On the **Add new account** popup, enter a name for the account, `ngrok.com` in the **Domain** field, and then click **Save**.
3. On the left menu, click **Backoffice**, click **Users**, and then click **Add New**.
4. On the **Add new user** popup, enter a name, email, select the account you have created, and then click **Save**.
By default, the user is assigned the **Admin** role.

## 2. Configure ngrok 

ngrok can use Frontegg SSO in two ways:

- From the ngrok CLI (using the `--oidc` parameter)
- From the ngrok dashboard

### **Option 1**: ngrok CLI

<Note>
This tutorial assumes you have an app running locally (for example, on `localhost:3000`) with the ngrok client installed.
</Note>

1. Launch a terminal.
2. Enter the following command to launch an ngrok tunnel with Frontegg SSO:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000 --oidc=FRONTEGG_OAUTH_URL \
   --oidc-client-id=FRONTEGG_CLIENT_ID \
   --oidc-client-secret=FRONTEGG_CLIENT_SECRET \
   ```

   Replace the following with the values:
   - FRONTEGG_OAUTH_URL: Your Frontegg **Domain name** URL (for example, `https://app-123456.frontegg.com`).
   - FRONTEGG_CLIENT_ID: The client ID you copied from Frontegg.
   - FRONTEGG_CLIENT_SECRET: The API key you copied from Frontegg.

   Alternatively, add the `--url YOUR_DOMAIN` argument to get your custom URL, replacing `YOUR_DOMAIN` with your URL of preference.
3. Copy the URL available next to **Forwarding** (for example, `https://frontegg-sso-test.ngrok.app`).
4. Skip to **Step 3**.

### **Option 2**: ngrok edge

To configure an edge with Frontegg:

1. Access the [ngrok Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/) and sign in using your ngrok account.
2. On the left menu, click **Universal Gateway** and then click **Edges**.
3. If you don't have an edge already set to add Frontegg SSO, create a test edge:
   - Click **+ New Edge**.
   - Click **Create HTTPS Edge**.
   - Click the **pencil icon** next to "no description", enter `Frontegg SSO OIDC` as the edge name and click **Save**.
4. On the edge settings menu, click **OIDC**.
5. Click **Begin setup** and enter the following values into the fields:
   - **Issuer URL**: Your Frontegg **Domain name** URL (for example, `https://app-123456.frontegg.com`).
   - **Client ID**: The client ID you copied from Frontegg.
   - **Client Secret**: The API key you copied from Frontegg.
6. Click **Save** at the top, and then click the left arrow to go back to the **Edges** page.
7. Launch a tunnel connected to your Frontegg edge:

   <Note>
   This step assumes you have an app running locally (for example, on `localhost:3000`) with the ngrok client installed.
   </Note>

8. Click **Start a tunnel**.
9. Click the **copy icon** next to the tunnel command.
10. Launch a tunnel:
    - Launch a terminal.
    - Paste the command but replace `http://localhost:80` with your localhost app address (such as `http://localhost:3000`).
    - Press **Enter** and an ngrok tunnel associated with your edge configuration will launch.
11. To confirm that the tunnel is connected to your edge:
    - Return to the ngrok dashboard.
    - Close the **Start a tunnel** and the **Tunnel group** tabs.
    - Refresh the test edge page.
    Under traffic, you will see the message _You have 1 tunnel online. Start additional tunnels to begin load balancing_.
12. In the test edge, copy the **endpoint URL**.
You use this URL to test the Frontegg authentication.

## 3. Test the integration

1. In your browser, launch an incognito window.
2. Access your ngrok tunnel (for example, `https://frontegg-sso-test.ngrok.app` or using the copied endpoint URL).
3. You should be prompted to log in with your Frontegg credentials.
4. After logging in, you should be able to see your web app.
