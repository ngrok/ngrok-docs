This guide explains how to configure Wallix Trustelem as the primary Identity Provider for ngrok tunnels using single sign-on (SSO).
By integrating Wallix Trustelem SSO with ngrok, you can:

- Restrict access to ngrok tunnels only to users authenticated via Wallix Trustelem
- Use Wallix Trustelem security policies and MFA authenticators
- Use Wallix Trustelem's Dashboard to facilitate access to ngrok apps

The ngrok integration with Wallix Trustelem supports SP-Initiated SSO.
In this mode, users access ngrok edges and tunnels and are redirected to Wallix Trustelem for authentication.

## What you'll need

- A Wallix Trustelem account with administrative rights to create apps.
- An ngrok Enterprise account with an authtoken or admin access to configure edges with OpenID Connect.

## 1. Configure Wallix Trustelem

- Access the WALLIX Trustelem administration console and sign in using your Trustelem account.
- On the **Dashboard** page, click **Apps** on the left menu, click **Add an application**, click the **OpenID Connect application** tile in the **Generic models** section.
- On the **Settings** popup, enter `ngrok oidc` in the **Name** field, enter `https://idp.ngrok.com/oauth2/callback` in the **RedirectURI** field, and enter `https://trustelem-sso-test.ngrok.app` in the **Login URL** field.
- On the **Settings** popup, make note of the value of both the **ClientID** and the **ClientSecret** fields, and then click **Save**.
- Make note of the value of the URL of the **Issuer** field and then click **Close**.

## 2. Configure ngrok

ngrok can use Wallix Trustelem SSO in two ways:

- From the ngrok CLI (using the `--oidc` parameter)
- From the ngrok dashboard

### **Option 1**: ngrok CLI

<Note>
  This tutorial assumes you have an app running locally (for example, on `localhost:3000`) with the ngrok client installed.
</Note>

- Launch a terminal.
- Enter the following command to launch an ngrok tunnel with Wallix Trustelem SSO:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000 --oidc=TRUSTELEM_OAUTH_URL \
  --oidc-client-id=TRUSTELEM_CLIENT_ID \
  --oidc-client-secret=TRUSTELEM_CLIENT_SECRET \
  ```

  Replace the following with values:
  - TRUSTELEM_OAUTH_URL: The issuer URL you copied from the Trustelem console.
  - TRUSTELEM_CLIENT_ID: The client ID you copied from the Trustelem console.
  - TRUSTELEM_CLIENT_SECRET: The client secret you copied from the Trustelem console.

  Alternatively, add the `--url YOUR_DOMAIN` argument to get your custom URL, replacing `YOUR_DOMAIN` with your URL of preference.

- Copy the URL available next to **Forwarding** (for example, `https://trustelem-sso-test.ngrok.app`).
- Skip to **Step 3**.

### **Option 2**: ngrok edge

To configure an edge with Wallix Trustelem:

- Access the [ngrok Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/) and sign in using your ngrok account.
- On the left menu, click **Universal Gateway** and then click **Edges**.
- If you don't have an edge already set to add Wallix Trustelem SSO, create a test edge:
  - Click **+ New Edge**.
  - Click **Create HTTPS Edge**.
  - Click the **pencil icon** next to "no description", enter `Edge with Trustelem SSO OIDC` as the edge name, and click **Save**.
- On the edge settings menu, click **OIDC**.
- Click **Begin setup** and enter the following values into the fields:
  - **Issuer URL**: The issuer URL you copied from the Trustelem console.
  - **Client ID**: The client ID you copied from the Trustelem console.
  - **Client Secret**: The client secret you copied from the Trustelem console.
- Click **Save** at the top.
- Launch a tunnel connected to your Wallix Trustelem edge:

<Note>
    This step assumes you have an app running locally (for example, on `localhost:3000`) with the ngrok client installed.

</Note>

- Click **Start a tunnel**.
- Click the **copy icon** next to the tunnel command.
- Launch a tunnel:
  - Launch a terminal.
  - Paste the command but replace `http://localhost:80` with your localhost app address (such as `http://localhost:3000`).
  - Press **Enter** and an ngrok tunnel associated with your edge configuration will launch.
- To confirm that the tunnel is connected to your edge:
  - Return to the ngrok dashboard.
  - Close the **Start a tunnel** and the **Tunnel group** tabs.
  - Refresh the test edge page.
    Under traffic, you will see the message _You have 1 tunnel online. Start additional tunnels to begin load balancing_.
- In the test edge, copy the **endpoint URL**.
  You use this URL to test the Wallix Trustelem authentication.

## Grant access to Wallix Trustelem users

Wallix Trustelem allows its users to access OIDC-integrated apps.
To create a user, follow the instructions below:

- On the left menu of the WALLIX Trustelem administration console, click **Users** and then click **Create User**.
- Enter values for **First Name**, **Last Name**, and **Primary Email** fields, and then click **Save**.

## Test the integration

- In your browser, launch an incognito window.
- Access your ngrok tunnel (for example, `https://trustelem-sso-test.ngrok.app` or using the copied endpoint URL).
- You should be prompted to log in with your Wallix Trustelem credentials.
- After logging in, you should be able to see your web app.
