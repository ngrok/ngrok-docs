This guide walks you through configuring ngrok to use Amazon OAuth (Login with Amazon) for user authentication.
The steps below follow Amazon's [Register for Login with Amazon](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/login-with-amazon/register-web.html) documentation for websites.

## What you'll need

- Your [Amazon Developer account](https://developer.amazon.com/loginwithamazon/console/site/lwa/overview.html) (sign up if you don't have one).
- Your ngrok authtoken and an endpoint with the OAuth action in its Traffic Policy.

## Create a security profile for ngrok

1. Navigate to the [Login with Amazon](https://developer.amazon.com/loginwithamazon/console/site/lwa/overview.html) portal and sign in with your Amazon Developer credentials.

<Note>If you don't have a developer account, you'll need to sign up for a new one.</Note>

2. Click **Create a New Security Profile**, provide a **Name** and a **Description** for your security profile, enter your application's privacy URL (for example, `https://ngrok.com/privacy`) in the **Consent Privacy Notice URL**, and then click **Save**.

3. Click **Show Client ID and Client Secret** to reveal your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** and make a note of both.

4. Hover over the gear icon of the **Security Profile** you created and then click **Web Settings**.

5. On the **Security Profile** page, click **Edit**, enter `https://idp.ngrok.com/oauth2/callback` in the **Allowed Return URLs** field, and then click **Save**.
