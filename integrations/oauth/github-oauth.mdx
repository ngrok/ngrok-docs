This guide walks you through creating a GitHub OAuth app and configuring ngrok to use it for user authentication.

## What you'll need

- A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account with permission to create OAuth apps.
- Your ngrok authtoken and an endpoint with the OAuth action in its Traffic Policy.

## Create a GitHub OAuth application

1. Follow [GitHub's documentation for creating an OAuth app](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/) until the final step of submitting the registration form.
2. Set the **Authorization callback URL** to `https://idp.ngrok.com/oauth2/callback`.
3. Submit the form.
4. From the application overview, save your **Client ID** and **Client secret** for use in ngrok.

## Update your ngrok endpoint Traffic Policy

## Known limitations

- Users who use GitHub's [private email setting](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address#:~:text=If%20you%27d%20like%20to%20keep%20your%20personal,to%20Keep%20my%20email%20address%20private) are not able to sign in.
