sidebarTitle: Azure Kubernetes Service
---

This guide walks you through launching a new cluster with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and a demo app, then adding the ngrok Kubernetes Operator to route public traffic to your demo app through an encrypted tunnel.

It covers the [ngrok Kubernetes Operator](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator) and AKS (a managed Kubernetes environment from Microsoft that simplifies deployment, health monitoring, and maintenance of cloud native applications in Azure, on-premises, or at the edge).

## What you'll need

- An Azure account with permissions to create new Kubernetes clusters.
- An ngrok account.
- kubectl and Helm 3.0.0+ installed on your local workstation.
- The [ngrok Kubernetes Operator](/k8s/) installed on your cluster.
- A reserved domain from the ngrok [dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains) or [API](/api-reference/reserveddomains/list); this guide refers to it as `<NGROK_DOMAIN>`.

## Create your cluster in AKS

Start by creating a new managed Kubernetes cluster in AKS.
If you already have one, you can skip to [Add ngrok's Kubernetes ingress to your demo app](#add-ngroks-kubernetes-ingress-to-your-demo-app).

1. In your Azure console, go to Kubernetes services and click **Create**, then **Create a Kubernetes cluster**.

2. Configure your new cluster with the wizard.
   Default options are generally fine; you can adjust cluster configuration (production vs dev/test), region, and AKS pricing tier (the **Free** tier works well with fewer than 10 nodes).

3. Click **Review + create** and wait for Azure to validate your configuration.
   If you see a **Validation failed** warning, check the errors (often related to quota limits).
   When ready, click **Create**; deployment can take a while.

4. When AKS completes the deployment, click **Go to deployment**, then **Connect** for kubectl connection options.
   Use the Cloud shell or Azure CLI as instructed, then verify your cluster's services:

   ```bash
   kubectl get deployments --all-namespaces=true
   NAMESPACE         NAME                      READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
   calico-system     calico-kube-controllers   1/1     1            1           5m
   calico-system     calico-typha              1/1     1            1           5m
   kube-system       ama-metrics               1/1     1            1           5m
   kube-system       ama-metrics-ksm           1/1     1            1           5m
   kube-system       coredns                   2/2     2            2           5m
   kube-system       coredns-autoscaler        1/1     1            1           5m
   kube-system       konnectivity-agent        2/2     2            2           5m
   kube-system       metrics-server            2/2     2            2           5m
   tigera-operator   tigera-operator           1/1     1            1           5m
   ```

## Deploy a demo microservices app

To showcase this integration, deploy the AKS Store demo app (a microservices architecture connecting frontend UI to API-like services with RabbitMQ and MongoDB) directly in the Azure Portal.

<Tip>
  If you prefer the CLI, save the YAML below to a `.yaml` file on your local workstation and deploy with `kubectl apply -f ...`.

    selector:
      app: store-front
    type: LoadBalancer
  ```

- Click **Add** to deploy the demo app.
  To double-check services deployed successfully, click **Workloads** in the Azure Portal and look for `store-front`, `rabbitmq`, `product-service`, and `order-service` in the `default` namespace.
  If you prefer the CLI, you can run `kubectl get pods` for the same information.

## Add ngrok's Kubernetes ingress to your demo app

Next, you'll configure and deploy the [ngrok Kubernetes Operator](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator) to expose your demo app to the public internet through the ngrok cloud service.

- In the Azure Portal, click **Create**, then **Apply a YAML**.

- Copy and paste the YAML below into the editor.
  This manifest defines how the ngrok Kubernetes Operator should route traffic arriving on `NGROK_DOMAIN` to the `store-front` service on port `80`, which you deployed in the previous step.

<Tip>
    Edit line `9` of the YAML below (the `NGROK_DOMAIN` variable) with the ngrok subdomain you created earlier.

</Tip>

```yaml showLineNumbers
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: store-ingress
spec:
  ingressClassName: ngrok
  rules:
    - host: NGROK_DOMAIN
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: store-front
                port:
                  number: 80
```

- Click **Add** to deploy the ingress configuration.
  Check ingress status in the Azure Portal under **Services and ingresses**, then **Ingresses**; you should see `store-ingress` and your ngrok subdomain.
  To edit the ingress later, click the ingress and open the **YAML** tab.

- Navigate to your ngrok subdomain (for example, `https://NGROK_DOMAIN.ngrok.app`) in your browser to see the demo app.
  ngrok's cloud service routes requests to the ngrok Kubernetes Operator, which forwards them to the `store-front` service.

## Add OAuth authentication to your demo app

Now that your demo app is publicly accessible through the ngrok cloud service, you can quickly layer on [additional capabilities](/universal-gateway/http/), like authentication, without configuring and deploying complex infrastructure.
The process for restricting access to individual Google accounts or any Google account under a specific domain name is outlined below.

With the [Traffic Policy system](/traffic-policy/) and the [`oauth` action](/traffic-policy/actions/oauth), ngrok manages OAuth protection entirely at the ngrok cloud service.
This means you don't need to add any additional services to your cluster, nor alter any routes, to ensure ngrok's edge authenticates and authorizes all requests before allowing ingress and access to your endpoint.

To enable the `oauth` action, you'll create a new `NgrokTrafficPolicy` custom resource and apply it to your entire `Ingress` with an annotation.
You can also apply the policy to just a specific backend or as the default backend for an `Ingress`—see the doc on using the [Operator with Ingresses](/k8s/guides/using-ingresses/#using-ngroktrafficpolicy-with-ingress).

- Edit your existing ingress YAML with the following.
  Note the new `annotations` field and the `NgrokTrafficPolicy` CR.

  ```yaml
  ---
  # Configuration for ngrok's Kubernetes Operator
  apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: Ingress
  metadata:
    name: game-2048-ingress
    namespace: default
    annotations:
      k8s.ngrok.com/traffic-policy: oauth
  spec:
    ingressClassName: ngrok
    rules:
      - host: <NGROK_DOMAIN>
        http:
          paths:
            - path: /
              pathType: Prefix
              backend:
                service:
                  name: game-2048
                  port:
                    number: 80
  ---
  # Traffic Policy configuration for OAuth
  apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
  kind: NgrokTrafficPolicy
  metadata:
    name: oauth
    namespace: default
  spec:
    policy:
      on_http_request:
        - type: oauth
          config:
            provider: google
  ```

- When you open your demo app again, you'll be asked to log in via Google.
  That's a start, but what if you want to authenticate only yourself or colleagues?

- You can use [expressions](/traffic-policy/concepts/expressions) and [CEL interpolation](/traffic-policy/concepts/cel-interpolation) to filter out and reject OAuth logins that don't contain `example.com`.
  Update the `NgrokTrafficPolicy` portion of your manifest after changing `example.com` to your domain.

  ```yaml
  # Traffic Policy configuration for OAuth
  apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
  kind: NgrokTrafficPolicy
  metadata:
    name: oauth
    namespace: default
  spec:
    policy:
      on_http_request:
        - type: oauth
          config:
            provider: google
        - expressions:
            - "!actions.ngrok.oauth.identity.email.endsWith('@example.com')"
          actions:
            - type: custom-response
              config:
                body: Hey, no auth for you ${actions.ngrok.oauth.identity.name}!
                status_code: 400
  ```

- Check out your deployed app once again.
  If you log in with an email that doesn't match your domain, ngrok rejects your request.

## What's next?

You've now used the open source ngrok Kubernetes Operator to add public ingress to a demo app on a cluster managed in AKS without having to worry about complex Kubernetes networking configurations.
Because ngrok abstracts ingress and middleware execution to its cloud service, you can follow a similar process to route public traffic to your next production-ready app.

For next steps, explore the [Kubernetes docs](/k8s/) for more details on how the Operator works, different ways you can integrate ngrok with an existing production cluster, or use more advanced features like [bindings](/k8s/guides/bindings/) or [endpoint pooling](/k8s/guides/pooling/).
