description: Send network traffic logs from ngrok to Datadog.

This guide walks you through sending ngrok events, including network traffic logs, to Datadog.
You may want to keep an audit log of configuration changes in your ngrok account, record all traffic to your endpoints for active monitoring and troubleshooting, or use Datadog as a SIEM for security inspections.

By integrating ngrok with Datadog, you can:

- Quickly identify application issues in real time using ngrok Traffic Events with Datadog ML-based monitoring.
- Historically audit changes occurring in an account.
- Visualize usage of your service using Datadog queries and analytic charts.
- Identify security issues using ngrok events and Datadog SIEM.

ngrok sends logs to the Datadog Logs API and automatically compresses them with gzip.
ngrok does not support the events or metrics APIs at this time.

## What you'll need

- Familiarity with the ngrok [events](/obs/events/reference) and which ones you want to send to Datadog.
- Your Datadog site confirmed (see Datadog documentation for accessing your site).
- A Datadog API key (see Datadog API documentation for creating or retrieving API keys).

## 1. Create a log export

- In a browser, go to the ngrok dashboard and navigate to **Events Stream** under **Traffic Observability** in the left navigation.
- Select **Create Subscription**.
- In the Log Exporting configuration, provide a description for the export.
- In the **Sources** tab, select **Add Source** to choose which events to send to Datadog.
- Select **Add Event Sources** to confirm your selections.

## 2. Create event destination

To send events to Datadog, assign an Event Destination to the Log Export.

- In the Log Exporting configuration **Destination** tab, select **Add Destination**.
- Choose Datadog as the target and fill in the required information, including which Datadog site your data uses.
**Target**, **Region**, and **API Key** are required; other values are optional:
  - **Service Name** is added as a key-value pair to the event payload as `service:value`.
  - **DD Tags** values are added as tags to the event data sent to Datadog.
- When all required inputs have values, select **Send Test Event**.
- You should see a Success message.
- Select **Done** to complete the Datadog Event Destination setup.

<Note>
**Troubleshooting:** If you receive a 403 error instead of a Success message, double-check your API key and confirm that you selected the correct Datadog site.
