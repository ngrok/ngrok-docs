---

This guide shows you how to expose your MQTT server to the internet using ngrok.
It covers setting up a local MQTT server, creating an ngrok TCP tunnel, and connecting to it using MQTT Explorer.

## What you'll need

- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup).
- The [ngrok agent](https://download.ngrok.com) installed.
- [MQTT Explorer](https://mqtt-explorer.com/) installed.
- The [Mosquitto binary](https://mosquitto.org/download/) installed.

## 1. Start an MQTT server

For this tutorial, use the [Eclipse Mosquitto quickstart](https://github.com/eclipse-mosquitto/mosquitto).

Start the server by running this command in your terminal:

```bash
mosquitto
```

The server runs by default on port `1883`.
You'll see output like this:

```bash
1734408888: mosquitto version 2.0.20 starting
1734408888: Using default config.
1734408888: Starting in local only mode. Connections will only be possible from clients running on this machine.
1734408888: Create a configuration file which defines a listener to allow remote access.
1734408888: For more details see https://mosquitto.org/documentation/authentication-methods/
1734408888: Opening ipv4 listen socket on port 1883.
1734408888: Opening ipv6 listen socket on port 1883.
1734408888: mosquitto version 2.0.20 running
```

## 2. Launch ngrok

Once your MQTT server is running successfully on `localhost`, you can put it online securely using ngrok.

Go to the [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com) and copy your authtoken.

Start ngrok by running the following command:

```bash
ngrok tcp 1883
```

ngrok will display a URL where your localhost application is exposed to the internet.
Copy this URL for use with MQTT Explorer.

## 3. Connect with MQTT Explorer

Open [MQTT Explorer](https://mqtt-explorer.com/) and click the plus sign to create a new MQTT connection.
Enter the TCP address from the last step and click **Connect**.

You'll see a few new lines in your MQTT server logs:

```bash
1734410153: New connection on port 1883.
1734410153: New client connected as mqtt-explorer-ba9b56f9 (p2, c1, k60).
```

MQTT Explorer is now connected to your server over the public internet.
To get messages from the client, subscribe to a topic.
In your terminal, open a tab and enter:

```bash
mosquitto_sub -t 'example/topic' -v
```

Back in MQTT Explorer, publish a message to `example/topic`.

You'll see the message in the terminal tab where you subscribed to the topic:

```bash
example/topic hello world
```
