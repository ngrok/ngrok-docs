<Tip>
**TL;DR**



To integrate Jira webhooks with ngrok:

1. [Launch your local webhook.](#1-start-your-app) `npm start`
1. [Launch ngrok.](#2-launch-ngrok) `ngrok http 3000`
1. [Configure Jira webhooks with your ngrok URL.](#3-integrate-jira)
1. [Secure your webhook requests with verification.](#secure-webhook-requests)
</Tip>

This guide covers how to use ngrok to integrate your localhost app with Jira by using Webhooks.
Jira webhooks can be used to notify an external application whenever specific events occur in your Jira instance.

By integrating ngrok with Jira, you can:

- **Develop and test Jira webhooks locally**, eliminating the time in deploying your development code to a public environment and setting it up in HTTPS.
- **Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Jira** in real-time via the inspection UI and API.
- **Modify and Replay Jira Webhook requests** with a single click and without spending time reproducing events manually in your Jira instance.
- **Secure your app with Jira validation provided by ngrok**. Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## 1. Start your app 

For this tutorial, we'll use the [sample NodeJS app available on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install this sample, run the following commands in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

This will get the project installed locally.

Now you can launch the app by running the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs by default on port 3000.

You can validate that the app is up and running by visiting http://localhost:3000. The application logs request headers and body in the terminal and responds with a message in the browser.

## 2. Launch ngrok 

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

1. If you're not an ngrok user yet, just [sign up for ngrok for free](https://ngrok.com/signup).

1. [Download the ngrok agent](https://download.ngrok.com).

1. Go to the [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com) and copy your Authtoken. <br />
   **Tip:** The ngrok agent uses the auth token to log into your account when you start a tunnel.
1. Start ngrok by running the following command:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

1. ngrok will display a URL where your localhost application is exposed to the internet (copy this URL for use with Jira).

## 3. Integrate Jira 

Jira can trigger webhook calls to external applications whenever events happen in your Jira instance. To register for such events, follow the instructions below:

1. Sign in to [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) with an account that has the **Jira Administrators** global permission.

1. Navigate to the **Settings** icon (⚙️) and select **System**.

1. Under the **Advanced** section, click on **WebHooks** and then **Create a WebHook**.

1. In the **Name** field, provide a descriptive name for the webhook (e.g., "ngrok Integration Webhook").

1. In the **URL** field, enter the URL provided by the ngrok agent to expose your application to the internet in the **URL** field (that is, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).
   ![URL](../img/jira/img/ngrok_url_configuration_jira.png)

1. Under the **Events** section, select the specific events that should trigger the webhook. 

1. (Optional) To limit the scope of the webhook, you can specify a JQL (Jira Query Language) query in the **JQL** field. For example, to trigger the webhook only for issues in specific projects:
   ```
   project in (ABC, XYZ)
   ```
1. Finally, click **Create**.

### Run Webhooks with Jira and ngrok

After you create a webhook in Jira, Jira will submit a POST request to your application through ngrok whenever the selected events occur.

To trigger a webhook event:

1. In your Jira instance, navigate to a project and create a new issue, or update an existing issue.

1. Confirm your localhost app receives the webhook notification and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

<InspectingRequests />

<ReplayingRequests />

## Secure webhook requests 

The ngrok signature webhook verification feature allows ngrok to assert that requests from your Jira webhook are the only traffic allowed to make calls to your localhost app.

**Note:** This ngrok feature is limited to 500 validations per month on free ngrok accounts. For unlimited, upgrade to Pro or Enterprise.

This is a quick step to add extra protection to your application.

1. In your Jira webhook settings, locate the **Secret** field. If a secret is not already set, you can generate one or use a custom secret value. Copy this secret value.

1. Create a traffic policy file named `jira_policy.yml`, replacing `{your secret}` with your **Secret** from Jira:

   ```yaml
   on_http_request:
     - actions:
         - type: verify-webhook
           config:
             provider: jira
             secret: "{your secret}"
   ```

1. Restart your ngrok agent by running the command:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file jira_policy.yml
   ```

1. In your Jira instance, create or update an issue to trigger the webhook.

1. Verify that your local application receives the request and logs information to the terminal.
