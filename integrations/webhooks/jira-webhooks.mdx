This guide covers how to use ngrok to integrate your localhost app with Jira by using Webhooks.
Jira webhooks can be used to notify an external application whenever specific events occur in your Jira instance.

By integrating ngrok with Jira, you can:

- **Develop and test Jira webhooks locally** - No need to deploy your code and set up HTTPS.
- **Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Jira in real-time using ngrok's inspection UI and API**.
- **Modify and Replay Jira Webhook requests with a single click** - No need to reproduce events manually in your Jira instance.
- **Secure your app with Jira validation provided by ngrok** - Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## What you'll need

- An [ngrok account](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup).
- Your [ngrok auth token](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
- Configure [the ngrok agent CLI](/getting-started#1-install-the-ngrok-agent-cli) locally.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app available on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install it, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

Launch the app with the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs by default on port `3000`.

You can validate that the app is up and running by visiting http://localhost:3000.
The application logs request headers and body in the terminal and responds with a message in the browser.

## 2. Launch ngrok

<Tip>  If you haven't done all the preliminary steps for this tutorial, [you should do them now](#what-you'll-need).
</Tip>

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

1. Start ngrok by running the following command:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```
1. ngrok will display a URL where your localhost application is exposed to the internet (copy this URL for use with Jira).

## 3. Integrate Jira

Jira can trigger webhook calls to external applications whenever events happen in your instance.
To register for such events:

1. Sign in to [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) with an account that has the **Jira Administrators** global permission.

1. Navigate to the **Settings** icon (⚙️) and select **System**.

1. Under the **Advanced** section, select **WebHooks**, then select **Create a WebHook**.

1. In the **Name** field, provide something descriptive like "ngrok Integration Webhook".

1. In the **URL** field, enter the URL provided by the ngrok agent to put your app online at that address. For example, your URL might be something like `https://1234-abcd-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`.
1. Under the **Events** section, select the specific events that should trigger the webhook.
1. (Optional) To limit the scope of the webhook, you can specify a JQL (Jira Query Language) query in the **JQL** field. For example, to trigger the webhook only for issues in specific projects:
   ```
   project in (ABC, XYZ)
   ```
1. Finally, select **Create**.

## Get more out of Jira with ngrok

ngrok can do more than just put your Jira application online.
Check out these other quick wins ngrok offers you.

### Run webhooks with Jira and ngrok

After you create a webhook in Jira, Jira will submit a POST request to your application through ngrok whenever the selected events occur.

To trigger a webhook event:

1. In your Jira instance, navigate to a project and create a new issue, or update an existing issue.

1. Confirm your localhost app receives the webhook notification and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

<InspectingRequests />

<ReplayingRequests />

### Secure webhook requests

The ngrok signature webhook verification feature allows ngrok to assert that requests from your Jira webhook are the only traffic allowed to make calls to your localhost app.

<Note>
  This ngrok feature is limited to 500 validations per month on free ngrok accounts.
  For unlimited, upgrade to Pro or Enterprise.
</Note>

This is a quick step to add extra protection to your application.

1. In your Jira webhook settings, locate the **Secret** field. If a secret is not already set, you can generate one or use a custom secret value. Copy this secret value.

1. Create a Traffic Policy file named `jira_policy.yml`, replacing `{your secret}` with your **Secret** from Jira:

   ```yaml
   on_http_request:
     - actions:
         - type: verify-webhook
           config:
             provider: jira
             secret: "{your secret}"
   ```

1. Restart your ngrok agent by running the command:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file jira_policy.yml
   ```

1. In your Jira instance, create or update an issue to trigger the webhook.

1. Verify that your local application receives the request and logs information to the terminal.
