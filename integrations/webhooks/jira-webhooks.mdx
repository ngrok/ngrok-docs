This guide shows you how to use ngrok to receive Jira webhooks on your localhost app.

By integrating ngrok with Jira, you can:

- Develop and test Jira webhooks locally without deploying to a public environment or setting up HTTPS.
- Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Jira in real time via the inspection UI and API.
- Modify and replay Jira webhook requests with a single click instead of reproducing events manually in your Jira instance.
- Secure your app with Jira webhook validation provided by ngrok.
  Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## What you'll need

- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup) and your [authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
- The [ngrok agent](https://ngrok.com/download) installed.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (for the sample app, or use your own app).
- A Jira instance and an account with **Jira Administrators** permission.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install the sample, run the following in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

Then start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs on port 3000 by default.

You can confirm it's running by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
The app logs request headers and body in the terminal and shows a message in the browser.

## 2. Expose your app with ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

- Copy [your ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) from the dashboard.

<Tip>
  The ngrok agent uses your authtoken to authenticate when you start a tunnel.
</Tip>

- Start ngrok:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000
  ```

- Copy the URL ngrok displays.
  Your app is now exposed at that URL for use with Jira.

## 3. Configure Jira to send webhooks

Jira can send webhook requests to your app when events occur in your instance.
To register for those events:

- Sign in to [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) with an account that has **Jira Administrators** permission.
- Open the **Settings** icon and select **System**.
- Under **Advanced**, select **WebHooks** and then **Create a WebHook**.
- In **Name**, enter a description (for example, `ngrok Integration Webhook`).
- In **URL**, enter your ngrok URL (for example, `https://1234-abcd-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).
- Under **Events**, select the events that should trigger the webhook.
- Optionally, enter a JQL query in **JQL** to limit scope (for example, `project in (ABC, XYZ)`).
- Click **Create**.

### Run webhooks with Jira and ngrok

After you create the webhook, Jira sends a POST request to your app through ngrok when the selected events occur.
To trigger an event:

- In your Jira instance, create a new issue or update an existing issue in a project that matches your webhook scope.

Confirm your localhost app receives the webhook and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

<InspectingRequests />

<ReplayingRequests />

## Secure webhook requests

ngrok can verify that incoming requests are from your Jira webhook so only that traffic reaches your app.

<Note>
  Webhook verification is limited to 500 validations per month on free accounts.
  If you need more, you can upgrade to Hobbyist or Pay-as-you-go.
  See [TPU Pricing](/pricing-limits/traffic-policy-unit-pricing/) for details.
</Note>

To add verification:

- In your Jira webhook settings, find the **Secret** field, generate or set a secret, and copy the value.
- Create a Traffic Policy file named `jira_policy.yml`.
  Replace `{your secret}` with the secret from Jira:

  ```yaml
  on_http_request:
    - actions:
        - type: verify-webhook
          config:
            provider: jira
            secret: "{your secret}"
  ```

- Restart ngrok with the policy file:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file jira_policy.yml
  ```

- Create or update an issue in Jira to trigger the webhook.

Your app should receive the request and log it in the terminal.
