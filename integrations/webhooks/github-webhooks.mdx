This guide walks you through using ngrok to receive GitHub repository webhooks on your localhost app.

By integrating ngrok with GitHub, you can:

- Develop and test GitHub webhooks locally without deploying to a public environment or setting up HTTPS.
- Inspect and troubleshoot requests from GitHub in real time via the inspection UI and API.
- Modify and replay GitHub webhook requests with a single click instead of reproducing events manually in GitHub.
- Secure your app with GitHub webhook validation provided by ngrok.
  Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## What you'll need

- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup) and your [authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
- The [ngrok agent](https://ngrok.com/download) installed.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (for the sample app, or use your own app).
- Your GitHub account and a repository.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install the sample, run the following in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

Then start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs on port 3000 by default.

You can confirm it's running by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
The app logs request headers and body in the terminal and shows a message in the browser.

## 2. Expose your app with ngrok

With your app running locally, expose it with ngrok.

- Copy [your ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) from the dashboard.

<Tip>  The ngrok agent uses your authtoken to authenticate when you start a tunnel.
</Tip>

- Start ngrok:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000
  ```

- Copy the URL ngrok displays.
  Your app is now exposed at that URL for use with GitHub.

## 3. Configure GitHub to send webhooks

GitHub can send webhook requests to your app when repository events occur.
To register for those events:

- Sign in to [GitHub](https://github.com).
- Open a repository from your repositories list.

<Tip>  If you don't have a repository, create an empty one first.
</Tip>

- In the repository, go to **Settings** and select **Webhooks** in the left menu.
- Click **Add webhook**.
- In **Payload URL**, paste the ngrok URL (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).
- Set **Content type** to `application/json`.
- Choose which events trigger the webhook (for this example, select **Just the push event**).
- Leave the webhook active and click **Add webhook**.

### Run webhooks with GitHub and ngrok

After you add the webhook, GitHub sends POST requests to your app through ngrok.

To compare what GitHub sends with what your app receives:

- Open the webhook you created.
- Click the **Recent Deliveries** tab.
- Select a delivery by ID.

Compare that delivery's headers and body with what your application received; they should match.

<Note>
  The payload your app receives depends on the events you chose.
  Because this example uses **Just the push event**, push changes to the repository to trigger new webhook calls.
  To resend a request, click **Redeliver** in the **Recent Deliveries** tab on the webhook page.

## Secure webhook requests

ngrok can verify that incoming requests are from your GitHub webhook so only that traffic reaches your app.

<Note>
  Webhook verification is limited to 500 validations per month on free accounts.
  If you need more, you can upgrade to Hobbyist or Pay-as-you-go.
  See [TPU Pricing](/pricing-limits/traffic-policy-unit-pricing/) for details.
</Note>

To add verification:

- Create a Traffic Policy file named `github_policy.yml`.
  Replace `{your secret}` with the **Secret** from your GitHub webhook:

  ```yaml
  on_http_request:
    - actions:
        - type: verify-webhook
          config:
            provider: github
            secret: "{your secret}"
  ```

- Restart ngrok with the policy file:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file github_policy.yml
  ```

- Resend a delivery from your GitHub webhook.

Your app should receive the request and log it in the terminal.
