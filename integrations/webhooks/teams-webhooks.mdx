This guide explains how to use ngrok to receive Microsoft Teams webhooks on your localhost app.

By integrating ngrok with Microsoft Teams, you can:

- Develop and test Microsoft Teams webhooks locally without deploying to a public environment or setting up HTTPS.
- Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Microsoft Teams in real time via the inspection UI and API.
- Modify and replay Microsoft Teams webhook requests with a single click instead of reproducing events manually in your Microsoft Teams account.
- Secure your app with Microsoft Teams webhook validation provided by ngrok.
  Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## What you'll need

- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup) and your [authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
- The [ngrok agent](https://ngrok.com/download) installed.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (for the sample app, or use your own app).
- A Microsoft account and a Microsoft Teams page with an app.

<Note>  This integration requires an ngrok Pro or Enterprise license because Microsoft Teams validates your ngrok domain and certificate.
</Note>

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install the sample, run the following in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

Then start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs on port 3000 by default.

You can confirm it's running by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
The app logs request headers and body in the terminal and shows a message in the browser.

## 2. Expose your app with ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

- Copy [your ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) from the dashboard.

<Tip>
  The ngrok agent uses your authtoken to authenticate when you start a tunnel.
  You need a reserved domain: in the dashboard, expand **Universal Gateway**, click **Domains**, then **+ Create Domain** or **+ New Domain**, and reserve a domain (for example, `myexample.ngrok.app`).
</Tip>

- Start ngrok with your reserved domain:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000 --url myexample.ngrok.app
  ```

- Copy the URL ngrok displays (for example, `https://myexample.ngrok.app`).
  Your app is now exposed at that URL for use with Microsoft Teams.

## 3. Configure Microsoft Teams to send webhooks

Microsoft Teams can send webhook requests to your app when you use an outgoing webhook in a channel.
To set it up:

- Sign in to the [Microsoft Teams web interface](https://teams.microsoft.com/) (or use the Teams app).
- Click **Teams**, select a channel, and click the **+** at the top of the team page.
- In **Add a tab**, click **Manage apps** and then **Create an outgoing webhook** at the bottom.
- In **Create an outgoing webhook**, enter **Name** and **Description** (for example, `My local app`) and your ngrok URL in **Callback URL** (for example, `https://myexample.ngrok.app`).
- Click **Create** and note the **Security token** on the confirmation popup, then click **Close**.

### Run webhooks with Microsoft Teams and ngrok

The outgoing webhook acts as a bot: when you @mention it, it sends the message to your app.

- In a channel, type `@My local app` (or your webhook name) and press Enter.

Your localhost app receives the notification and logs both headers and body in the terminal.
The bot may reply with a message such as `{ message: "Thank you for the message" }`.

## Secure webhook requests

ngrok can verify that incoming requests are from your Microsoft Teams webhook so only that traffic reaches your app.

<Note>
  Webhook verification is limited to 500 validations per month on free accounts.
  If you need more, you can upgrade to Hobbyist or Pay-as-you-go.
  See [TPU Pricing](/pricing-limits/traffic-policy-unit-pricing/) for details.
</Note>

To add verification:

- Use the **Security token** you copied when creating the outgoing webhook (see [Configure Microsoft Teams to send webhooks](#3-configure-microsoft-teams-to-send-webhooks)).
- Create a Traffic Policy file named `teams_policy.yml`.
  Replace `{your app secret}` with that Security token:

  ```yaml
  on_http_request:
    - actions:
        - type: verify-webhook
          config:
            provider: microsoft_teams
            secret: "{your app secret}"
  ```

- Restart ngrok with the policy file:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file teams_policy.yml
  ```

- In Teams, send another message using the @mention for your webhook.

Your app should receive the request and log it in the terminal.
