<Tip>
**TL;DR**



To integrate Worldline webhooks with ngrok:

1. [Launch your local webhook.](#start-your-app) `npm start`
1. [Launch ngrok.](#start-ngrok) `ngrok http 3000`
1. [Configure Worldline webhooks with your ngrok URL.](#setup-webhook)
1. [Secure your webhook requests with verification.](#security)
</Tip>

This guide covers how to use ngrok to integrate your localhost app with Worldline by using Webhooks.
Worldline webhooks can be used to notify an external application whenever specific events occur in your Worldline account.

By integrating ngrok with Worldline, you can:

- **Develop and test Worldline webhooks locally**, eliminating the time in deploying your development code to a public environment and setting it up in HTTPS.
- **Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Worldline** in real-time via the inspection UI and API.
- **Modify and Replay Worldline Webhook requests** with a single click and without spending time reproducing events manually in your Worldline account.
- **Secure your app with Worldline validation provided by ngrok**. Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## 1. Start your app 

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app available on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install this sample, run the following commands in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

This will get the project installed locally.

Now you can launch the app by running the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs by default on port 3000.

You can validate that the app is up and running by visiting http://localhost:3000. The application logs request headers and body in the terminal and responds with a message in the browser.

## 2. Launch ngrok 

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

1. If you're not an ngrok user yet, just [sign up for ngrok for free](https://ngrok.com/signup).

1. [Download the ngrok agent](https://download.ngrok.com).

1. Go to the [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com) and copy your Authtoken. <br />
   **Tip:** The ngrok agent uses the auth token to log into your account when you start a tunnel.
1. Start ngrok by running the following command:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

1. ngrok will display a URL where your localhost application is exposed to the internet (copy this URL for use with Worldline).

## 3. Integrate Worldline 

To register a webhook on your Worldline account follow the instructions below:

1. Access [Worldline](https://www.worldline.com/) and sign in using your Worldline account.

1. On the left menu, click **Developer** and then click **Webhooks**.

1. On the **Webhooks** page, click **Create a Webhook**.

1. On the **Webhooks** page, click **Generate webhook keys** and make note of the **Secret Webhook Key** field value.

1. Click **Add webhook endpoint**, enter the URL provided by the ngrok agent to expose your application to the internet in the **Endpoint URL** field (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`), and then click **Confirm**.

### Run webhooks with Worldline and ngrok

Worldline sends different request body contents depending on the event that is being triggered.
You can trigger a test call from Worldline to your application by following the instructions below.

1. In the same browser, click **Payment links** on the left menu and then click **Generate link**.

1. On the **Generate link** page, enter a value in the **Amount** and **Order reference** fields, and then click **Generate link**.

1. On the **Share link** page, click the copy icon close to the payment link, paste this link to a new browser tab, select **Bancontact** as the payment method, and then click **Cancel**.

   Confirm your localhost app receives post request notifications and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

## Secure webhook requests 

The ngrok signature webhook verification feature allows ngrok to assert that requests from your Worldline webhook are the only traffic allowed to make calls to your localhost app.

**Note:** This ngrok feature is limited to 500 validations per month on free ngrok accounts. For unlimited, upgrade to Pro or Enterprise.

This is a quick step to add extra protection to your application.

1. Create a Traffic Policy file named `worldline_policy.yml`, replacing `{your webhook secret}` with the value of the **Secret Webhook Key** (See [Integrate ngrok and Worldline.](#setup-webhook)):

   ```yaml
   on_http_request:
     - actions:
         - type: verify-webhook
           config:
             provider: worldline
             secret: "{your webhook secret}"
   ```

1. Restart your ngrok agent by running the command:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file worldline_policy.yml
   ```

1. Access [Worldline](https://www.worldline.com/), sign in, create a new payment link, open the link in a new browser tab, and select **Bancontact** as the payment method.

Verify that your local application receives the request and logs information to the terminal.
