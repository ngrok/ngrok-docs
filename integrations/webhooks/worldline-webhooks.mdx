This guide shows you how to use ngrok to receive Worldline webhooks on your localhost app.

By integrating ngrok with Worldline, you can:

- Develop and test Worldline webhooks locally without deploying to a public environment or setting up HTTPS.
- Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Worldline in real time via the inspection UI and API.
- Modify and replay Worldline webhook requests with a single click instead of reproducing events manually in your Worldline account.
- Secure your app with Worldline webhook validation provided by ngrok.
  Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## What you'll need

- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup) and your [authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
- The [ngrok agent](https://ngrok.com/download) installed.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (for the sample app, or use your own app).
- A Worldline account.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install the sample, run the following in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

Then start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs on port 3000 by default.

You can confirm it's running by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
The app logs request headers and body in the terminal and shows a message in the browser.

## 2. Expose your app with ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

- Copy [your ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) from the dashboard.

<Tip>
  The ngrok agent uses your authtoken to authenticate when you start a tunnel.
</Tip>

- Start ngrok:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000
  ```

- Copy the URL ngrok displays.
  Your app is now exposed at that URL for use with Worldline.

## 3. Configure Worldline to send webhooks

Worldline can send webhook requests to your app when payment and other events occur.
To register for those events:

- Sign in to [Worldline](https://www.worldline.com/).
- Go to **Developer** > **Webhooks** and click **Create a Webhook**.
- Click **Generate webhook keys** and note the **Secret Webhook Key**.
- Click **Add webhook endpoint**, enter your ngrok URL in **Endpoint URL** (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`), and click **Confirm**.

### Run webhooks with Worldline and ngrok

Worldline sends different request body contents depending on the event.
To trigger a test:

- In Worldline, go to **Payment links** > **Generate link**.
- Enter **Amount** and **Order reference** and click **Generate link**.
- On **Share link**, copy the payment link, open it in a new tab, select **Bancontact** (or another method), and click **Cancel**.

Confirm your localhost app receives the POST and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

## Secure webhook requests

ngrok can verify that incoming requests are from your Worldline webhook so only that traffic reaches your app.

<Note>
  Webhook verification is limited to 500 validations per month on free accounts.
  If you need more, you can upgrade to Hobbyist or Pay-as-you-go.
  See [TPU Pricing](/pricing-limits/traffic-policy-unit-pricing/) for details.
</Note>

To add verification:

- Use the **Secret Webhook Key** you noted when creating the webhook (see [Configure Worldline to send webhooks](#3-configure-worldline-to-send-webhooks)).
- Create a Traffic Policy file named `worldline_policy.yml`.
  Replace `{your webhook secret}` with that value:

  ```yaml
  on_http_request:
    - actions:
        - type: verify-webhook
          config:
            provider: worldline
            secret: "{your webhook secret}"
  ```

- Restart ngrok with the policy file:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file worldline_policy.yml
  ```

- Create a new payment link, open it, and complete or cancel a payment to trigger the webhook.

Your app should receive the request and log it in the terminal.
