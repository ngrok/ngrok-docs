This guide walks you through using ngrok to receive Alchemy webhooks on your localhost app.

By integrating ngrok with Alchemy, you can:

- Develop and test Alchemy webhooks locally without deploying to a public environment or setting up HTTPS.
- Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Alchemy in real time via the inspection UI and API.
- Modify and replay Alchemy webhook requests with a single click instead of reproducing events manually in your Alchemy account.
- Secure your app with Alchemy webhook validation provided by ngrok.
  Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## What you'll need

- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup) and your [authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
- The [ngrok agent](https://ngrok.com/download) installed.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (for the sample app, or use your own app).
- An Alchemy account.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install the sample, run the following in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

Then start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs on port 3000 by default.

You can confirm it's running by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
The app logs request headers and body in the terminal and shows a message in the browser.

## 2. Expose your app with ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

- Copy [your ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) from the dashboard.

<Tip>  The ngrok agent uses your authtoken to authenticate when you start a tunnel.
</Tip>

- Start ngrok:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000
  ```

- Copy the URL ngrok displays.
  Your app is now exposed at that URL for use with Alchemy.

## 3. Configure Alchemy to send webhooks

Alchemy can send webhook requests to your app when events occur in your account.
To register for those events:

- Sign in to the [Alchemy dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/).
- In the left menu, click the **Data** icon and then **Webhooks**.
- On the **Webhooks** page, click **Create Webhook** for one of the types (for this tutorial, use **Address Activity**).
- Select the **Chain** and **Network** you want to monitor, then paste the ngrok URL in the **WEBHOOK URL** field (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).
- Click **Test Webhook** and verify your localhost app receives a notification event.
- Enter your wallet address in **Ethereum Address** and click **Create Webhook**.

### Run webhooks with Alchemy and ngrok

Alchemy sends different request body contents depending on the type of webhook.
Because this example uses **Address Activity**, you need to receive or send tokens to your address to trigger events.

To test your webhook:

- In the [Alchemy dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/), go to **Data** and **Webhooks**.
- In the **Address Activity** section, click the 3 dots for the webhook you registered and click **Send Test Notification**.

Confirm your localhost app receives the test event and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

## Secure webhook requests

ngrok can verify that incoming requests are from your Alchemy webhook so only that traffic reaches your app.

<Note>
  Webhook verification is limited to 500 validations per month on free accounts.
  If you need more, you can upgrade to Hobbyist or Pay-as-you-go.
  See [TPU Pricing](/pricing-limits/traffic-policy-unit-pricing/) for details.
</Note>

To add verification:

- In the [Alchemy dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/), go to **Data** and **Webhooks**.
- In the **Address Activity** section, click the 3 dots for your webhook and click **Signing Key**.
- In the popup, copy the **Signing key** value and click **Close**.
- Create a Traffic Policy file named `alchemy_policy.yml`.
  Replace `{your signing key}` with the value you copied:

  ```yaml
  on_http_request:
    - actions:
        - type: verify-webhook
          config:
            provider: alchemy
            secret: "{your signing key}"
  ```

- Restart ngrok with the policy file:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file alchemy_policy.yml
  ```

<Note>
  After restarting ngrok, the tunnel URL changes.
  Alchemy does not allow editing webhook URLs, so it's recommended to create a [reserved domain](/universal-gateway/domains/) on your ngrok account and run the agent with `--domain your-domain.ngrok.app`.
</Note>

- Test the webhook from the Alchemy dashboard or trigger an event with the Alchemy SDK.

Your app should receive the request and log it in the terminal.
