This guide walks you through using ngrok to receive Cisco Webex webhooks on your localhost app.

By integrating ngrok with Cisco Webex, you can:

- Develop and test Cisco Webex webhooks locally without deploying to a public environment or setting up HTTPS.
- Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Cisco Webex in real time via the inspection UI and API.
- Modify and replay Cisco Webex webhook requests with a single click instead of reproducing events manually in your Cisco Webex account.
- Secure your app with Cisco Webex webhook validation provided by ngrok.
  Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## What you'll need

- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup) and your [authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
- The [ngrok agent](https://ngrok.com/download) installed.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (for the sample app, or use your own app).
- A Cisco Webex account.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install the sample, run the following in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

Then start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs on port 3000 by default.

You can confirm it's running by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
The app logs request headers and body in the terminal and shows a message in the browser.

## 2. Expose your app with ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

- Copy [your ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) from the dashboard.

<Tip>
  The ngrok agent uses your authtoken to authenticate when you start a tunnel.
</Tip>

- Start ngrok:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000
  ```

- Copy the URL ngrok displays.
  Your app is now exposed at that URL for use with Cisco Webex.

## 3. Configure Cisco Webex to send webhooks

Cisco Webex can send webhook requests to your app when events occur (e.g. meeting started).
To register:

- Sign in to the [Cisco Webex Developer Portal](https://developer.webex.com/) and obtain a [Personal Access Token](https://developer.webex.com/docs/getting-started#accounts-and-authentication).
- Register the webhook with the API. Example:

  ```bash
  curl --location 'https://webexapis.com/v1/webhooks' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{
    "name": "localhost app via ngrok webhook",
    "targetUrl": "URL",
    "resource": "meetings",
    "event": "started",
    "secret": "SECRET_KEY"
  }'
  ```

  Replace `TOKEN` with your Personal Access Token, `URL` with your ngrok URL (e.g. `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`), and `SECRET_KEY` with a value used to sign requests.

### Run webhooks with Cisco Webex and ngrok

You subscribed to the **meetings** / **started** event.
To trigger a call:

- Sign in to [Cisco Webex](https://www.webex.com) and click **Start a meeting**.

Confirm your localhost app receives the notification and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

<ReplayingRequests />

## Secure webhook requests

ngrok can verify that incoming requests are from your Cisco Webex webhook so only that traffic reaches your app.

<Note>
  Webhook verification is limited to 500 validations per month on free accounts.
  If you need more, you can upgrade to Hobbyist or Pay-as-you-go.
  See [TPU Pricing](/pricing-limits/traffic-policy-unit-pricing/) for details.
</Note>

To add verification:

- Use the **SECRET_KEY** value you set when registering the webhook (see [Configure Cisco Webex to send webhooks](#3-configure-cisco-webex-to-send-webhooks)).
- Create a Traffic Policy file named `webex_policy.yml`.
  Replace `{your webhook secret}` with that value:

  ```yaml
  on_http_request:
    - actions:
        - type: verify-webhook
          config:
            provider: webex
            secret: "{your webhook secret}"
  ```

- Restart ngrok with the policy file:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file webex_policy.yml
  ```

- Start a meeting in [Cisco Webex](https://www.webex.com) to trigger the webhook.

Your app should receive the request and log it in the terminal.
