This guide covers how to use ngrok to integrate your localhost app with Cisco Webex by using Webhooks.
Cisco Webex webhooks can be used to notify an external application whenever specific events occur in your Cisco Webex account.

By integrating ngrok with Cisco Webex, you can:

- **Develop and test Cisco Webex webhooks locally**, eliminating the time in deploying your development code to a public environment and setting it up in HTTPS.
- **Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Cisco Webex** in real-time via the inspection UI and API.
- **Modify and Replay Cisco Webex Webhook requests** with a single click and without spending time reproducing events manually in your Cisco Webex account.
- **Secure your app with Cisco Webex validation provided by ngrok**. Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app available on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install this sample, run the following commands in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

This will get the project installed locally.

Now you can launch the app by running the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs by default on port 3000.

You can validate that the app is up and running by visiting http://localhost:3000. The application logs request headers and body in the terminal and responds with a message in the browser.

## 2. Launch ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

1. If you're not an ngrok user yet, just [sign up for ngrok for free](https://ngrok.com/signup).

1. [Download the ngrok agent](https://download.ngrok.com).

1. Go to the [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com) and copy your Authtoken. <br />
   **Tip:** The ngrok agent uses the auth token to log into your account when you start a tunnel.
1. Start ngrok by running the following command:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

1. ngrok will display a URL where your localhost application is exposed to the internet (copy this URL for use with Cisco Webex).

## 3. Integrate Cisco Webex

To register a webhook on your Cisco Webex account follow the instructions below:

1. Access [Cisco Webex Developer Portal](https://developer.webex.com/), sign in using your Cisco Webex account, and then open the (Personal Access Token documentation)[https://developer.webex.com/docs/getting-started#accounts-and-authentication] in the same browser tab.

1. Click the copy icon in the **Your Personal Access Token** field.

1. Open a terminal window and run the following command to register your webhook:

   ```bash
   curl --location 'https://webexapis.com/v1/webhooks' \
   --header 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN' \
   --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{
   "name": "localhost app via ngrok webhook", \
   "targetUrl": "URL", \
   "resource": "meetings", \
   "event": "started",
   "secret":"SECRET_KEY"
   }'
   ```

   **Note**: Replace the following with values copied on previous steps:
   - TOKEN: **Your Personal Access Token**.
   - URL: the URL provided by the ngrok agent to expose your application to the internet (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).
   - SECRET_KEY: A value to sign each request sent to your application.

### Run webhooks with Cisco Webex and ngrok

In the previous section, you registered a webhook to trigger calls to your application whenever you create a meeting.
You can trigger new calls from Cisco Webex to your application by following the instructions below.

1. Access [Cisco Webex](https://www.webex.com), sign in, and then click **Start a meeting**.

   Confirm your localhost app receives the create-project event notification and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

<ReplayingRequests />
## Secure webhook requests

The ngrok signature webhook verification feature allows ngrok to assert that requests from your Cisco Webex webhook are the only traffic allowed to make calls to your localhost app.

**Note:** This ngrok feature is limited to 500 validations per month on free ngrok accounts. For unlimited, upgrade to Pro or Enterprise.

This is a quick step to add extra protection to your application.

1. Create a Traffic Policy file named `webex_policy.yml`, replacing `{your webhook secret}` with the **SECRET_KEY** value you provided during the webhook registration (See [Integrate ngrok and Cisco Webex.](#setup-webhook)):

   ```yaml
   on_http_request:
     - actions:
         - type: verify-webhook
           config:
             provider: webex
             secret: "{your webhook secret}"
   ```

1. Restart your ngrok agent by running the command:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file webex_policy.yml
   ```

1. Access [Cisco Webex](https://www.webex.com), sign in, and then click **Start a meeting**.

Verify that your local application receives the request and logs information to the terminal.
