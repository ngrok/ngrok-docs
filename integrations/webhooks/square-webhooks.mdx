This guide explains how to use ngrok to receive Square webhooks on your localhost app.

By integrating ngrok with Square, you can:

- Develop and test Square webhooks locally without deploying to a public environment or setting up HTTPS.
- Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Square in real time via the inspection UI and API.
- Modify and replay Square webhook requests with a single click instead of reproducing events manually in your Square account.
- Secure your app with Square webhook validation provided by ngrok.
  Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## What you'll need

- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup) and your [authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
- The [ngrok agent](https://ngrok.com/download) installed.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (for the sample app, or use your own app).
- A Square account.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install the sample, run the following in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

Then start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs on port 3000 by default.

You can confirm it's running by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
The app logs request headers and body in the terminal and shows a message in the browser.

## 2. Expose your app with ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

- Copy [your ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) from the dashboard.

<Tip>
  The ngrok agent uses your authtoken to authenticate when you start a tunnel.
</Tip>

- Start ngrok:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000
  ```

- Copy the URL ngrok displays.
  Your app is now exposed at that URL for use with Square.

## 3. Configure Square to send webhooks

Square can send webhook requests to your app when events occur in your account.
To register for those events:

- Sign in to [Square Developer](https://developer.squareup.com/apps).
- Click the plus sign to add an application, enter **Application name** (for example, `myLocalhostApp`), accept the terms, and click **Save**.
- On **Applications**, click **Open** for the app.
- In the left menu under **Webhooks**, click **Subscriptions**.
- On **Webhook subscriptions**, select **Production** and click **Add subscription**.
- In the popup, enter a **Webhook name** (for example, `Create Items Webhook`), enter your ngrok URL in **URL** (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).
- Under **Events**, select **catalog.version.updated** and click **Save**.

### Run webhooks with Square and ngrok

Because you selected **catalog.version.updated**, creating or updating catalog items triggers webhooks:

- In the [Square Dashboard](https://squareup.com/dashboard), go to **Items & orders** and **Items** (or **Items** under **Quick access**).
- Click **Create an item**, fill in **Name**, **Category**, **SKU**, **Price**, and click **Save**.

Confirm your localhost app receives the notification and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

<Tip>
  Square sends different request body contents depending on the event you selected.
</Tip>

You can also check **Logs** under **Webhooks** in the Square Developer app page to see the request Square sent.

## Secure webhook requests

ngrok can verify that incoming requests are from your Square webhook so only that traffic reaches your app.

<Note>
  Webhook verification is limited to 500 validations per month on free accounts.
  If you need more, you can upgrade to Hobbyist or Pay-as-you-go.
  See [TPU Pricing](/pricing-limits/traffic-policy-unit-pricing/) for details.
</Note>

To add verification:

- In [Square Developer](https://developer.squareup.com/apps), open your application.
- Scroll to **Access token**, click **Show**, and copy the value (**Sandbox Access token** or **Production Access token** depending on your environment).
- Create a Traffic Policy file named `square_policy.yml`.
  Replace `{your access token}` with the value you copied:

  ```yaml
  on_http_request:
    - actions:
        - type: verify-webhook
          config:
            provider: square
            secret: "{your access token}"
  ```

- Restart ngrok with the policy file:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file square_policy.yml
  ```

- Create a new item in the [Square Dashboard](https://squareup.com/dashboard/) to trigger the webhook.

Your app should receive the request and log it in the terminal.
