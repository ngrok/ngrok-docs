This guide explains how to use ngrok to receive Amazon SNS topic notifications on your localhost app.

By integrating ngrok with Amazon SNS, you can:

- Develop and test Amazon SNS webhooks locally without deploying to a public environment or setting up HTTPS.
- Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Amazon SNS in real time via the inspection UI and API.
- Modify and replay Amazon SNS webhook requests with a single click instead of reproducing notifications manually in your SNS topic.
- Secure your app with Amazon SNS webhook validation provided by ngrok.
  Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## What you'll need

- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup) and your [authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
- The [ngrok agent](https://ngrok.com/download) installed.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (for the sample app, or use your own app).
- An [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) account.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install the sample, run the following in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

Then start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs on port 3000 by default.

You can confirm it's running by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
The app logs request headers and body in the terminal and shows a message in the browser.

## 2. Expose your app with ngrok

With your app running locally, expose it with ngrok.

- Copy [your ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) from the dashboard.

<Tip>
  The ngrok agent uses your authtoken to authenticate when you start a tunnel.
</Tip>

- Start ngrok:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000
  ```

- Copy the URL ngrok displays.
  Your app is now exposed at that URL for use with Amazon SNS.

## 3. Configure Amazon SNS to send webhooks

Amazon SNS can send HTTPS notifications to your app when messages are published to a topic.
To set this up:

- Sign in to [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).
- In the AWS console search bar, enter `sns` and open **Simple Notification Service**.
- On the SNS **Dashboard**, click **Topics** in the left menu and click **Create topic**.
- On **Create topic**, select **Standard**, enter a name (for example, `MyTopic`) in **Name**, and click **Create topic**.
- Click **Subscriptions** in the left menu and click **Create subscription**.
- On **Create subscription**, select your topic in **Topic ARN**, select **HTTPS** in **Protocol**, and paste the ngrok URL in **Endpoint** (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).
- Click **Create subscription**.
- Confirm your localhost app receives a **SubscriptionConfirmation** notification and logs both headers and body in the terminal.
- From the request body, copy the value of **SubscribeURL**.
- On the SNS **Subscriptions** page, select the **Pending confirmation** subscription, click **Confirm subscription**, paste the **SubscribeURL** value in the **url** field, and click **Confirm subscription**.

You should see **Subscription was confirmed successfully**.

### Run webhooks with Amazon SNS and ngrok

Publishing a message to your SNS topic triggers your HTTPS subscription.
To publish a message manually:

- In the AWS console, search for `sns` and open **Simple Notification Service**.
- On the SNS **Dashboard**, click **Topics** and open the topic you created.
- On the topic page, click **Publish message**, enter a subject in **Subject**, enter a body in **Message body to send to the endpoint**, and click **Publish message**.

Confirm your localhost app receives a notification and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

## Secure webhook requests

ngrok can verify that incoming requests are from your Amazon SNS topic so only that traffic reaches your app.

<Note>
  Webhook verification is limited to 500 validations per month on free accounts.
  If you need more, you can upgrade to Hobbyist or Pay-as-you-go.
  See [TPU Pricing](/pricing-limits/traffic-policy-unit-pricing/) for details.
</Note>

To add verification:

- In the [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) console, open the Amazon SNS **Dashboard** and click **Topics**.
- Open your topic and copy the value of **Topic owner**.
- Create a Traffic Policy file named `amazon_sns_policy.yml`.
  Replace `{Topic owner}` with the value you copied:

  ```yaml
  on_http_request:
    - actions:
        - type: verify-webhook
          config:
            provider: sns
            secret: "{Topic owner}"
  ```

- Restart ngrok with the policy file:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file amazon_sns_policy.yml
  ```

- Publish a new message to your topic from the AWS console.

Your app should receive the request and log it in the terminal.
