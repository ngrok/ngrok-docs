This guide covers how to use ngrok to integrate your localhost app with Amazon SNS by using Webhooks.
Amazon SNS webhooks can be used to notify an external application whenever a message is published to a topic.

By integrating ngrok with Amazon SNS, you can:

- **Develop and test Amazon SNS webhooks locally**, eliminating the time in deploying your development code to a public environment and setting it up in HTTPS.
- **Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Amazon SNS** in real-time via the inspection UI and API.
- **Modify and Replay Amazon SNS Webhook requests** with a single click and without spending time reproducing notifications manually in your Amazon SNS topic.
- **Secure your app with Amazon SNS validation provided by ngrok**. Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app available on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install this sample, run the following commands in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

This will get the project installed locally.

Now you can launch the app by running the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs by default on port 3000.

You can validate that the app is up and running by visiting http://localhost:3000.
The application logs request headers and body in the terminal and responds with a message in the browser.

## 2. Launch ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

1. If you're not an ngrok user yet, just [sign up for ngrok for free](https://ngrok.com/signup).

1. [Download the ngrok agent](https://download.ngrok.com).

1. Go to the [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com) and copy your Authtoken. <br />
   **Tip:** The ngrok agent uses the auth token to log into your account when you start a tunnel.
1. Start ngrok by running the following command:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

1. ngrok will display a URL where your localhost application is exposed to the internet (copy this URL for use with Amazon SNS).

## 3. Integrate Amazon SNS

To register a webhook on your Amazon SNS topic follow the instructions below.

1. Access [Amazon Cloud Service](https://aws.amazon.com/) and sign in using your Amazon account.

1. On the AWS dashboard, enter `sns` in the search bar and then click the **Simple Notification Service** link that appears in the list.

1. On the Amazon SNS **Dashboard** page, click **Topics** on the left menu, and then click **Create topic**.

1. On the **Create topic** page, click the **Standard** tile, enter `MyTopic` in the **Name** field, and then click **Create topic**.

1. Click **Subscriptions** on the left menu and then click **Create subscription**.

1. On the **Create subscription** page, select your topic in the **Topic ARN** field, select **HTTPS** in the **Protocol** field, and enter the URL provided by the ngrok agent to expose your application to the internet in the **Endpoint** field (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).
   ![Endpoint](../img/amazon-sns/ngrok_url_configuration_amazonsns.png)

1. Click **Create subscription**.

1. Confirm your localhost app receives a **SubscriptionConfirmation** notification and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

1. Copy the value of the **SubscribeURL** field from the body of the request.

1. On the Amazon SNS **Subscriptions** page, select the **Pending confirmation** subscription from the list, click **Confirm subscription**, enter the value of the **SubscribeURL** in the **url** field, and then click **Confirm subscription**.

   You should receive a message that says **Subscription was confirmed successfully**.

### Run webhooks with Amazon SNS and ngrok

Any message published to the Amazon SNS topic triggers your HTTPS subscription.
To publish a message to the SNS topic manually, follow the steps below:

1. On the AWS dashboard, enter `sns` in the search bar and then click the **Simple Notification Service** link that appears in the list.

1. On the Amazon SNS **Dashboard**, click **Topics** on the left menu, and then click the topic you previously associated with the Lambda function.

1. On the topic page, click **Publish message**, enter `My message` in the **Subject** field, enter `This is my message` in the **Message body to send to the endpoint** field, and then click **Publish message**.

   Confirm your localhost app receives a notification and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

## Secure webhook requests

The ngrok signature webhook verification feature allows ngrok to assert that requests from your Amazon SNS topic are the only traffic allowed to make calls to your localhost app.

**Note:** This ngrok feature is limited to 500 validations per month on free ngrok accounts.
For unlimited, upgrade to Pro or Enterprise.

This is a quick step to add extra protection to your application.

1. Access [Amazon Cloud Service](https://aws.amazon.com/), sign in using your Amazon account, and access the Amazon SNS **Dashboard** page.

1. Click **Topics** on the left menu, click your topic and copy the value of the **Topic owner** field.

1. Create a Traffic Policy file named `amazon_sns_policy.yml`, replacing `{Topic owner}` with the value you copied before:

   ```yaml
   on_http_request:
     - actions:
         - type: verify-webhook
           config:
             provider: sns
             secret: "{Topic owner}"
   ```

1. Restart your ngrok agent by running the command:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file amazon_sns_policy.yml
   ```

1. Access [Amazon Cloud Service](https://aws.amazon.com/), sign in using your Amazon account, access the Amazon SNS **Dashboard** page, and publish a new message to your topic.

Verify that your local application receives the request and logs information to the terminal.
