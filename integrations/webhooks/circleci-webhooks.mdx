This guide covers how to use ngrok to integrate your localhost app with CircleCI by using Webhooks.
CircleCI webhooks can be used to notify an external application whenever specific events occur in your CircleCI account.

By integrating ngrok with CircleCI, you can:

- **Develop and test CircleCI webhooks locally**, eliminating the time in deploying your development code to a public environment and setting it up in HTTPS.
- **Inspect and troubleshoot requests from CircleCI** in real-time via the inspection UI and API.
- **Modify and Replay CircleCI Webhook requests** with a single click and without spending time reproducing events manually in your CircleCI account.
- **Secure your app with CircleCI validation provided by ngrok**. Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app available on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install this sample, run the following commands in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

This will get the project installed locally.

Now you can launch the app by running the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs by default on port 3000.

You can validate that the app is up and running by visiting http://localhost:3000.
The application logs request headers and body in the terminal and responds with a message in the browser.

## 2. Launch ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

1. If you're not an ngrok user yet, just [sign up for ngrok for free](https://ngrok.com/signup).

1. [Download the ngrok agent](https://download.ngrok.com).

1. Go to the [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com) and copy your Authtoken. <br />
   **Tip:** The ngrok agent uses the auth token to log into your account when you start a tunnel.
1. Start ngrok by running the following command:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

1. ngrok will display a URL where your localhost application is exposed to the internet (copy this URL for use with CircleCI).

## 3. Integrate CircleCI

To register a webhook on your CircleCI account follow the instructions below:

1. Access [CircleCI](https://www.circleci.com/) and sign in using your CircleCI account.

1. On the **All Pipelines** page, click the name of your pipeline.
   **Tip**: If you don't have one, create a new pipeline.

1. On your pipeline page, click **Project Settings** and then click **Webhooks** on the left menu.

1. On the **Webhooks** page, click **Add Webhook**.

1. On the **Add Webhook** page, enter a name in the **Webhook name** field, and in the **Receiver URL** field enter the URL provided by the ngrok agent to expose your application to the internet (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).

1. Enter `MySecretToken` in the **Secret token** field, click the **Workflow Completed** and **Job Completed** checkboxes under **Events**, and then click **Add Webhook**.

1. On the **Webhooks** page, click the name of your webhook, and then click **Test Ping Event**.

   Confirm your localhost app receives the test-ping event notification and logs both headers and body to the terminal.

### Run webhooks with CircleCI and ngrok

You can trigger new calls from CircleCI to your application by following the instructions below.

1. Access [CircleCI](https://www.circleci.com/) and sign in using your CircleCI account.
   **Tip**: If you are at the **Project Settings** page, click **&lt;** at the top left corner to return to your pipeline page.

1. On the **Pipeline** page, click **Rerun workflow from start** under the **Action** column for your pipeline.

   Confirm your localhost app receives event notifications related to the workflow you started and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

## Secure webhook requests

The ngrok signature webhook verification feature allows ngrok to assert that requests from your CircleCI webhook are the only traffic allowed to make calls to your localhost app.

**Note:** This ngrok feature is limited to 500 validations per month on free ngrok accounts.
For unlimited, upgrade to Pro or Enterprise.

This is a quick step to add extra protection to your application.

1. Create a Traffic Policy file named `circleci_policy.yml`, replacing `{your secret token}` with the value you have provided to the **Secret token** field during your webhook registration (See [Integrate ngrok and CircleCI](#setup-webhook)):

   ```yaml
   on_http_request:
     - actions:
         - type: verify-webhook
           config:
             provider: circleci
             secret: "{your secret token}"
   ```

1. Restart your ngrok agent by running the command:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file circleci_policy.yml
   ```

1. Access [CircleCI](https://www.circleci.com/) and Rerun your workflow from start.

   Verify that your local application receives the request and logs information to the terminal.
