This guide shows you how to use ngrok to receive Airship webhook notifications on your localhost app.

By integrating ngrok with Airship, you can:

- Develop and test Airship webhooks locally without deploying to a public environment or setting up HTTPS.
- Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Airship in real time via the inspection UI and API.
- Modify and replay Airship webhook requests with a single click instead of reproducing events manually in your Airship account.
- Secure your app with Airship webhook validation provided by ngrok.
  Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## What you'll need

- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup) and your [authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
- The [ngrok agent](https://ngrok.com/download) installed.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (for the sample app, or use your own app).
- An Airship account.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install the sample, run the following in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

Then start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs on port 3000 by default.

You can confirm it's running by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
The app logs request headers and body in the terminal and shows a message in the browser.

## 2. Expose your app with ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

- Copy [your ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) from the dashboard.

<Tip>
  The ngrok agent uses your authtoken to authenticate when you start a tunnel.
</Tip>

- Start ngrok:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000
  ```

- Copy the URL ngrok displays.
  Your app is now exposed at that URL for use with Airship.

## 3. Configure Airship to send webhooks

Airship can send webhook requests to your app when events occur.
To register for those events:

- Sign in to [Airship](https://www.airship.com/).
- On the **App Projects** page, click one of your projects.
- Go to **Settings**, then **Open Channels** under **Channels**, and click **Configure new Open Channel**.
- Enter `My Local Webhook` in **Display Name**, `MyLocalWebhook` in **Name**, and paste the ngrok URL in **Webhook URL** (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).
- Click **Save**.

### Run webhooks with Airship and ngrok

Airship sends different request body contents depending on the event that is triggered.
To trigger new calls from Airship to your app:

- Open your Airship application from the [Applications](https://go.airship.com/apps/) page.
- Go to **Messages**, then **Messages Overview**, and click the **+** icon in the top right.
- On the **What would you like to create** page, click the **Message** tile.
- On the **Who will receive your message** page, select **My Local Webhook** as the channel and select the users.
- Go to **Content**, click **Custom Message**, and enter any text in **Alert Text**.
- Go to **Delivery** and click **Send now**.
- Go to **Review & Send** and click **Send Message**.

Confirm your localhost app receives event notifications and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

## Secure webhook requests

ngrok can verify that incoming requests are from your Airship webhook so only that traffic reaches your app.

<Note>
  Webhook verification is limited to 500 validations per month on free accounts.
  If you need more, you can upgrade to Hobbyist or Pay-as-you-go.
  See [TPU Pricing](/pricing-limits/traffic-policy-unit-pricing/) for details.
</Note>

To add verification:

- In your Airship app, go to **Settings**, **Open Channels** under **Channels**, and click **Edit** on the **My Local Webhook** tile.
- Select **Signature** in **Authentication**, enter a value in **Secret Key** (for example, `12345`), and click **Update**.
- Create a Traffic Policy file named `airship_policy.yml`.
  Replace `{your secret}` with the value from **Secret Key**:

  ```yaml
  on_http_request:
    - actions:
        - type: verify-webhook
          config:
            provider: airship
            secret: "{your secret}"
  ```

- Restart ngrok with the policy file:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file airship_policy.yml
  ```

- Create a new message in Airship to trigger a webhook.

Your app should receive the request and log it in the terminal.
