This guide explains how to use ngrok to receive Intercom webhooks on your localhost app.

By integrating ngrok with Intercom, you can:

- Develop and test Intercom webhooks locally without deploying to a public environment or setting up HTTPS.
- Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Intercom in real time via the inspection UI and API.
- Modify and replay Intercom webhook requests with a single click instead of reproducing events manually in your Intercom account.
- Secure your app with Intercom webhook validation provided by ngrok.
  Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## What you'll need

- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup) and your [authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
- The [ngrok agent](https://ngrok.com/download) installed.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (for the sample app, or use your own app).
- An Intercom account.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install the sample, run the following in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

Then start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs on port 3000 by default.

You can confirm it's running by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
The app logs request headers and body in the terminal and shows a message in the browser.

## 2. Expose your app with ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

- Copy [your ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) from the dashboard.

<Tip>  The ngrok agent uses your authtoken to authenticate when you start a tunnel.
</Tip>

- Start ngrok:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000
  ```

- Copy the URL ngrok displays.
  Your app is now exposed at that URL for use with Intercom.

## 3. Configure Intercom to send webhooks

Intercom can send webhook requests to your app when events occur in your account.
To register for those events:

- Sign in to [Intercom](https://app.intercom.com/).
- Click your avatar (below the **What's new** bell icon) and then **Settings**.

<Note>  If your avatar doesn't appear, zoom out on the page.
</Note>

- Under **Apps & Integrations**, click **Developer Hub**.

<Note>  If the **Developer Guidelines** popup appears, click **Accept and Continue**.
</Note>

- Click **New App**, enter a name, select your workspace, keep **Internal integration** selected, and click **Create app**.
- In your app, click **Webhooks** under **Configure**.
- Enter your ngrok URL in **Your request endpoint URL** (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).
- Select **contact.user.created** in **Webhook topics** and click **Save**.

Intercom sends a test request to your app; confirm your localhost app receives it in the terminal.
You can click **Send a test request** on the Intercom **Webhooks** page to send another test.

### Run webhooks with Intercom and ngrok

With **contact.user.created** selected, you can trigger calls by creating a user:

- In [Intercom](https://app.intercom.com/), click **Contacts**.
- Click **New**, **New users or leads**, **Create new user**.
- Enter **Name**, **Email**, and **User ID** and click **Create a user**.

Confirm your localhost app receives the event and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

<Tip>  Intercom sends different request body contents depending on the events you selected when registering the webhook.

## Secure webhook requests

ngrok can verify that incoming requests are from your Intercom webhook so only that traffic reaches your app.

<Note>
  Webhook verification is limited to 500 validations per month on free accounts.
  If you need more, you can upgrade to Hobbyist or Pay-as-you-go.
  See [TPU Pricing](/pricing-limits/traffic-policy-unit-pricing/) for details.
</Note>

To add verification:

- In the Intercom **Developer Hub**, click your app and then **Basic information**.
- Copy the **Client secret** value.
- Create a Traffic Policy file named `intercom_policy.yml`.
  Replace `{your client secret}` with the value you copied:

  ```yaml
  on_http_request:
    - actions:
        - type: verify-webhook
          config:
            provider: intercom
            secret: "{your client secret}"
  ```

- Restart ngrok with the policy file:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file intercom_policy.yml
  ```

- Create a new contact in Intercom to trigger the webhook.

Your app should receive the request and log it in the terminal.
