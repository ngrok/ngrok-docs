This guide explains how to use ngrok to receive Zendesk webhooks on your localhost app.

By integrating ngrok with Zendesk, you can:

- Develop and test Zendesk webhooks locally without deploying to a public environment or setting up HTTPS.
- Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Zendesk in real time via the inspection UI and API.
- Modify and replay Zendesk webhook requests with a single click instead of reproducing events manually in your Zendesk account.
- Secure your app with Zendesk webhook validation provided by ngrok.
  Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## What you'll need

- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup) and your [authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
- The [ngrok agent](https://ngrok.com/download) installed.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (for the sample app, or use your own app).
- A Zendesk account.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install the sample, run the following in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

Then start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs on port 3000 by default.

You can confirm it's running by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
The app logs request headers and body in the terminal and shows a message in the browser.

## 2. Expose your app with ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

- Copy [your ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) from the dashboard.

<Tip>  The ngrok agent uses your authtoken to authenticate when you start a tunnel.
</Tip>

- Start ngrok:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000
  ```

- Copy the URL ngrok displays.
  Your app is now exposed at that URL for use with Zendesk.

## 3. Configure Zendesk to send webhooks

Zendesk can send webhook requests to your app when automation rules run.
To set it up:

- Sign in to [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com), go to **Admin** (gear icon) > **Admin Center**.
- Click **Apps and integrations** > **Webhooks** > **Create Webhooks**.
- On **Create webhook**, enter a **Name** and your ngrok URL in **Endpoint URL** (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).
- Set **Request method** to **POST** and **Request format** to **JSON** (for production you can add Basic or Bearer authentication; for this tutorial use **None**).
- Click **Test webhook** > **Send test**, confirm your app receives the request, then click **Create**.
- Create an automation: **Objects and rules** > **Automations** > **Add automation**. Set title, conditions (e.g. Ticket is Created, Type is Incident, Priority is High), and under **Perform these actions** add **Notify webhook** with a **JSON body** (e.g. `{"message":"{{ticket.requester.name}} we are setting your ticket {{ticket.title}} to urgent priority."}`). Click **Create automation**.

### Run webhooks with Zendesk and ngrok

With the automation above, a high-priority incident ticket triggers the webhook:

- In [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com), click **+ Add** > **Ticket**.
- Set **Requester**, **Type** to **Incident**, **Priority** to **High**, enter a subject, and click **Submit as New**.

Zendesk evaluates automations on a schedule (e.g. hourly), so you may need to wait for the webhook to be called.
You can check **Admin Center** > **Webhooks** > your webhook > **Activity** to see delivery logs.

## Secure webhook requests

ngrok can verify that incoming requests are from your Zendesk webhook so only that traffic reaches your app.

<Note>
  Webhook verification is limited to 500 validations per month on free accounts.
  If you need more, you can upgrade to Hobbyist or Pay-as-you-go.
  See [TPU Pricing](/pricing-limits/traffic-policy-unit-pricing/) for details.
</Note>

To add verification:

- In [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com), go to **Admin Center** > **Apps and integrations** > **Webhooks** and click your webhook.
- Click **Reveal secret** and **Copy** to copy the **Secret key**.
- Create a Traffic Policy file named `zendesk_policy.yml`.
  Replace `{your secret key}` with the value you copied:

  ```yaml
  on_http_request:
    - actions:
        - type: verify-webhook
          config:
            provider: zendesk
            secret: "{your secret key}"
  ```

- Restart ngrok with the policy file:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file zendesk_policy.yml
  ```

- Create another high-priority incident ticket (as in [Run webhooks with Zendesk and ngrok](#run-webhooks-with-zendesk-and-ngrok)) to trigger the webhook.

Your app should receive the request and log it in the terminal.
