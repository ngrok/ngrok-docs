This guide walks you through using ngrok to receive Svix incoming webhooks on your localhost app.

By integrating ngrok with Svix, you can:

- Develop and test Svix webhooks locally without deploying to a public environment or setting up HTTPS.
- Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Svix in real time via the inspection UI and API.
- Modify and replay Svix webhook requests with a single click instead of reproducing events manually in your Svix account.
- Secure your app with Svix webhook validation provided by ngrok.
  Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## What you'll need

- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup) and your [authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
- The [ngrok agent](https://ngrok.com/download) installed.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (for the sample app, or use your own app).
- A Svix account.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install the sample, run the following in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

Then start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs on port 3000 by default.

You can confirm it's running by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
The app logs request headers and body in the terminal and shows a message in the browser.

## 2. Expose your app with ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

- Copy [your ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) from the dashboard.

<Tip>
  The ngrok agent uses your authtoken to authenticate when you start a tunnel.
</Tip>

- Start ngrok:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000
  ```

- Copy the URL ngrok displays.
  Your app is now exposed at that URL for use with Svix.

## 3. Configure Svix to send webhooks

Svix can send incoming webhook requests to your app when events occur.
To register for those events:

- Sign in to the [Svix Dashboard](https://dashboard.svix.com/).
- In the left menu, click **Incoming Webhooks** and **Add Endpoint**.
- Enter your ngrok URL in **Endpoint URL** (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).
- Under **Message Filtering**, select the events you want (for example, **endpoint** and **message**) and click **Create**.
- On the webhook page, open the **Testing** tab and click **Send Example**.

Confirm your localhost app receives the request and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

### Run webhooks with Svix and ngrok

Svix sends different request body contents depending on the event.
To trigger more calls:

- In the [Svix Dashboard](https://dashboard.svix.com/), click **Consumer Applications** and your app (create one if needed).
- Click **Preview App Portal** and **Add Endpoint**.
- On **New Endpoint**, use **use Svix Play** or enter a URL in **Endpoint URL**, then click **Create**.

Confirm your localhost app receives the request.
You can verify delivery under **Incoming Webhooks**, **Logs**, in the Svix dashboard.

## Secure webhook requests

ngrok can verify that incoming requests are from your Svix webhook so only that traffic reaches your app.

<Note>
  Webhook verification is limited to 500 validations per month on free accounts.
  If you need more, you can upgrade to Hobbyist or Pay-as-you-go.
  See [TPU Pricing](/pricing-limits/traffic-policy-unit-pricing/) for details.
</Note>

To add verification:

- In the [Svix Dashboard](https://dashboard.svix.com/), go to **Incoming Webhooks**, click your webhook URL, and under **Signing Secret** click the eye icon and copy the value.
- Create a Traffic Policy file named `svix_policy.yml`.
  Replace `{your webhook secret}` with the value you copied:

  ```yaml
  on_http_request:
    - actions:
        - type: verify-webhook
          config:
            provider: svix
            secret: "{your webhook secret}"
  ```

- Restart ngrok with the policy file:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file svix_policy.yml
  ```

- Create a new endpoint or send a test from the Svix dashboard to trigger the webhook.

Your app should receive the request and log it in the terminal.
