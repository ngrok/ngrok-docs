This guide shows you how to use ngrok to receive Mailchimp webhooks on your localhost app.

By integrating ngrok with Mailchimp, you can:

- Develop and test Mailchimp webhooks locally without deploying to a public environment or setting up HTTPS.
- Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Mailchimp in real time via the inspection UI and API.
- Modify and replay Mailchimp webhook requests with a single click instead of reproducing events manually in your Mailchimp account.
- Secure your app with Mailchimp webhook validation provided by ngrok.
  Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## What you'll need

- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup) and your [authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
- The [ngrok agent](https://ngrok.com/download) installed.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (for the sample app, or use your own app).
- A Mailchimp account.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install the sample, run the following in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

Then start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs on port 3000 by default.

You can confirm it's running by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
The app logs request headers and body in the terminal and shows a message in the browser.

## 2. Expose your app with ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

- Copy [your ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) from the dashboard.

<Tip>  The ngrok agent uses your authtoken to authenticate when you start a tunnel.
</Tip>

- Start ngrok:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000
  ```

- Copy the URL ngrok displays.
  Your app is now exposed at that URL for use with Mailchimp.

## 3. Configure Mailchimp to send webhooks

Mailchimp can send webhook requests to your app when events occur in your audience.
To register for those events:

- Sign in to [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/).
- Click **Audience** and then **Audience dashboard**.
- Click **Manage Audience** and **Settings**.
- On the **Settings** page, click **Webhooks** and then **Create New Webhook**.
- On **Create new webhook**, enter your ngrok URL in **Callback URL** (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`) and click **Save**.

Confirm your localhost app receives the GET request and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

### Run webhooks with Mailchimp and ngrok

Mailchimp sends different request body contents depending on the audience and event.
To trigger new calls from Mailchimp to your app:

- Click **Audience** and **All Contacts**.
- Click **Add contacts** and **Add a subscriber**.
- On **Add subscriber**, enter a valid email in **Email Address**, check **This person gave me permission to email them**, and click **Subscribe**.

<Note>  If the email is not on your contact list, you may need to import the contact first.
</Note>

Confirm your localhost app receives the event and logs both headers and body in the terminal.
