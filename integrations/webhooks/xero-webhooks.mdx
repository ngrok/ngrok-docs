This guide walks you through using ngrok to receive Xero webhooks on your localhost app.

By integrating ngrok with Xero, you can:

- Develop and test Xero webhooks locally without deploying to a public environment or setting up HTTPS.
- Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Xero in real time via the inspection UI and API.
- Modify and replay Xero webhook requests with a single click instead of reproducing events manually in your Xero account.
- Secure your app with Xero webhook validation provided by ngrok.
  Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## What you'll need

- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup) and your [authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
- The [ngrok agent](https://ngrok.com/download) installed.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (for the sample app, or use your own app).
- A Xero account.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install the sample, run the following in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

Then start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs on port 3000 by default.

You can confirm it's running by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
The app logs request headers and body in the terminal and shows a message in the browser.

## 2. Expose your app with ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

- Copy [your ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) from the dashboard.

<Tip>
  The ngrok agent uses your authtoken to authenticate when you start a tunnel.
</Tip>

- Start ngrok:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000
  ```

- Copy the URL ngrok displays.
  Your app is now exposed at that URL for use with Xero.

## 3. Configure Xero to send webhooks

Xero can send webhook requests to your app when events occur in your organization.
To register for those events:

- Sign in to [Xero Developer](https://developer.xero.com/app/manage/) and open an app (or create one with **New app**).
- Click **Webhooks** in the left menu.
- On **Webhooks**, select the event types you want (e.g. **Billing subscriptions**, **Contacts**, **Invoices**) and enter your ngrok URL in **Delivery URL** (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).
- Click **Send 'Intent to Receive'** and confirm your app receives the request and logs headers and body, then click **Save**.
- In the [Xero dashboard](https://go.xero.com/), select your organization, go to **Settings** > **Connected Apps**, and confirm your app is connected.
  If not, authorize it using the OAuth URL from your app’s **Configuration** (Client id, Redirect URIs) and complete **User Consent**.

### Run webhooks with Xero and ngrok

Xero sends different request body contents depending on the event.
To trigger a notification:

- In the [Xero dashboard](https://go.xero.com/), select your organization.
- Go to **Contacts** > **New Contact**, fill in **Contact name**, **Account number**, **First Name**, **Last Name**, and click **Save & Close**.

Confirm your localhost app receives the event and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

## Secure webhook requests

ngrok can verify that incoming requests are from your Xero webhook so only that traffic reaches your app.

<Note>
  Webhook verification is limited to 500 validations per month on free accounts.
  If you need more, you can upgrade to Hobbyist or Pay-as-you-go.
  See [TPU Pricing](/pricing-limits/traffic-policy-unit-pricing/) for details.
</Note>

To add verification:

- In [Xero Developer](https://developer.xero.com/myapps/webhooks/), open your app and **Webhooks**.
- Copy the **Webhooks key** value.
- Create a Traffic Policy file named `xero_policy.yml`.
  Replace `{your webhook key}` with the value you copied:

  ```yaml
  on_http_request:
    - actions:
        - type: verify-webhook
          config:
            provider: xero
            secret: "{your webhook key}"
  ```

- Restart ngrok with the policy file:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file xero_policy.yml
  ```

- Create a new contact in the [Xero dashboard](https://go.xero.com/) to trigger the webhook.

Your app should receive the request and log it in the terminal.
