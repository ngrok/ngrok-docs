This guide covers how to use ngrok to integrate your localhost app with Xero by using Webhooks.
Xero webhooks can be used to notify an external application whenever specific events occur in your Xero account.

By integrating ngrok with Xero, you can:

- **Develop and test Xero webhooks locally**, eliminating the time in deploying your development code to a public environment and setting it up in HTTPS.
- **Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Xero** in real-time via the inspection UI and API.
- **Modify and Replay Xero Webhook requests** with a single click and without spending time reproducing events manually in your Xero account.
- **Secure your app with Xero validation provided by ngrok**. Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app available on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install this sample, run the following commands in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

This will get the project installed locally.

Now you can launch the app by running the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs by default on port 3000.

You can validate that the app is up and running by visiting http://localhost:3000.
The application logs request headers and body in the terminal and responds with a message in the browser.

## 2. Launch ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

1. If you're not an ngrok user yet, just [sign up for ngrok for free](https://ngrok.com/signup).

1. [Download the ngrok agent](https://download.ngrok.com).

1. Go to the [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com) and copy your Authtoken. <br />
   **Tip:** The ngrok agent uses the auth token to log into your account when you start a tunnel.
1. Start ngrok by running the following command:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

1. ngrok will display a URL where your localhost application is exposed to the internet (copy this URL for use with Xero).

## 3. Integrate Xero

To register a webhook on your Xero account follow the instructions below:

1. Access the [Xero Developer](https://developer.xero.com/app/manage/) site and sign in using your Xero account.

1. Click one of the apps listed on the **Apps** page. If you don't have an app, create one by clicking **New app**.

1. On the app page, click **Webhooks** on the left menu.

1. On the **Webhooks** page, click the checkbox for **Billing subscriptions**, **Contacts** and **Invoices**, and then enter the URL provided by the ngrok agent to expose your application to the internet in the **Delivery URL** field (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).

1. Click **Send 'Intent to Receive'**.

   Confirm your localhost app receives notification and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

1. Click **Save**.

1. Access the [Xero dashboard](https://go.xero.com/) site, sign in using your Xero account, and then select your organization in the drop-down menu.

1. Click your organization **Dashboard** page, click **Settings**, click **Connected Apps**, and then confirm your app appears in the list of **Connected apps**.

If your app isn't connected to your organization execute the following steps:

1. In a new browser tab, open the following URL:

   ```
   https://login.xero.com/identity/connect/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=APP_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=APP_REDIRECT_URI&scope=offline_access accounting.transactions openid profile email accounting.contacts accounting.settings&state=123
   ```

   **Note**: Replace the following with values copied from the **Configuration** page of your app on the [Xero Developer](https://developer.xero.com/app/manage/) site:
   - APP_CLIENT_ID: Your app **Client id**.
   - APP_REDIRECT_URI: Your app **Redirect URIs**.

1. On the **User Consent** page, select your organization and then click **Allow access**.

### Run webhooks with Xero and ngrok

Xero sends different request body contents depending on the event that is being triggered.
You can trigger new calls from Xero to your application by following the instructions below.

1. Access the [Xero dashboard](https://go.xero.com/) site, sign in using your Xero account, and then select your organization in the drop down menu.

1. On the organization **Dashboard** page, click **Contacts** at the top menu and then click **New Contact**.

1. On the **Add Contact** page, fill up the **Contact name**, **Account number**, **First Name**, and **Last Name** fields, and then click **Save & Close**.

   Confirm your localhost app receives an event notification and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

## Secure webhook requests

The ngrok signature webhook verification feature allows ngrok to assert that requests from your Xero webhook are the only traffic allowed to make calls to your localhost app.

**Note:** This ngrok feature is limited to 500 validations per month on free ngrok accounts. For unlimited, upgrade to Pro or Enterprise.

This is a quick step to add extra protection to your application.

1. Access [Xero Developer](https://developer.xero.com/myapps/webhooks/) page and sign in using your Xero account.

1. Click your app tile and then click **Webhooks** on the left menu.

1. Copy the value of the **Webhooks key**.

1. Create a Traffic Policy file named `xero_policy.yml`:

   ```yaml
   on_http_request:
     - actions:
         - type: verify-webhook
           config:
             provider: xero
             secret: { your webhook key }
   ```

   **Note**: Replace `{your webhook key}` with the value you copied before.

1. Restart your ngrok agent by running the command:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file xero_policy.yml
   ```

1. Access the [Xero dashboard](https://go.xero.com/) and create a new contact.

Verify that your local application receives the request and logs information to the terminal.
