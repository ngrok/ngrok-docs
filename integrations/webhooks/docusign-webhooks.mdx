This guide walks you through using ngrok to receive DocuSign webhooks on your localhost app.

By integrating ngrok with DocuSign, you can:

- Develop and test DocuSign webhooks locally without deploying to a public environment or setting up HTTPS.
- Inspect and troubleshoot requests from DocuSign in real time via the inspection UI and API.
- Modify and replay DocuSign webhook requests with a single click instead of reproducing events manually in your DocuSign account.
- Secure your app with DocuSign webhook validation provided by ngrok.
  Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## What you'll need

- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup) and your [authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
- The [ngrok agent](https://ngrok.com/download) installed.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (for the sample app, or use your own app).
- A DocuSign account.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install the sample, run the following in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

Then start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs on port 3000 by default.

You can confirm it's running by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
The app logs request headers and body in the terminal and shows a message in the browser.

## 2. Expose your app with ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

- Copy [your ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) from the dashboard.

<Tip>  The ngrok agent uses your authtoken to authenticate when you start a tunnel.
</Tip>

- Start ngrok:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000
  ```

- Copy the URL ngrok displays.
  Your app is now exposed at that URL for use with DocuSign.

## 3. Configure DocuSign to send webhooks

DocuSign can send webhook requests to your app when events occur in your account.
To register for those events:

- Sign in to [DocuSign](https://docusign.com/).
- In the top menu, click **Settings** and then click **Connect** under **INTEGRATIONS** in the left menu.
- On the **Connect** page, click **ADD CONFIGURATION** and then click **Custom**.
- On the **Add Custom Configuration** page, enter a name in **Name**, enter your ngrok URL in **URL to Publish** (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).
- Under **Trigger Events**, expand **Envelope and Recipients**, click **Envelope Sent**, and then click **ADD CONFIGURATION** at the bottom.

### Run webhooks with DocuSign and ngrok

DocuSign sends different request body contents depending on the event.
To trigger new calls from DocuSign to your app:

- Click **Manage** in the top menu and then **START NOW** to open your DocuSign inbox.
- On the **Upload a Document and Add Envelope Recipients** page, click **UPLOAD** and then **Desktop**.
- Select a document, expand **Add recipients**, and click **I'm the only signer**.

<Note>  You can optionally select a user from the **Name** list.
</Note>

- Click **SIGN** at the bottom right.

Confirm your localhost app receives the envelope event and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

You can verify the webhook in DocuSign: go to **Settings**, **Connect**, and the **LOGS** tab.

<ReplayingRequests />

## Secure webhook requests

ngrok can verify that incoming requests are from your DocuSign webhook so only that traffic reaches your app.

<Note>
  Webhook verification is limited to 500 validations per month on free accounts.
  If you need more, you can upgrade to Hobbyist or Pay-as-you-go.
  See [TPU Pricing](/pricing-limits/traffic-policy-unit-pricing/) for details.
</Note>

To add verification:

- In DocuSign, go to **Settings** and **Connect**, open the **CONNECT KEYS** tab, click **ADD SECRET KEY**, and copy the key value.
- In the **APPLICATIONS** tab, click your webhook and enable **Include HMAC Signature** in **Integration and Security Settings**.
- Create a Traffic Policy file named `docusign_policy.yml`.
  Replace `{your connect key}` with the value you copied:

  ```yaml
  on_http_request:
    - actions:
        - type: verify-webhook
          config:
            provider: docusign
            secret: "{your connect key}"
  ```

- Restart ngrok with the policy file:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file docusign_policy.yml
  ```

- Create a new envelope in [DocuSign](https://app.docusign.com/home) to trigger the webhook.

Your app should receive the request and log it in the terminal.
