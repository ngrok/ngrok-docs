<Tip>
**TL;DR**



To integrate Sonatype Nexus webhooks with ngrok:

1. [Launch your local webhook.](#start-your-app) `npm start`
1. [Launch ngrok.](#start-ngrok) `ngrok http 3000`
1. [Configure Sonatype Nexus webhooks with your ngrok URL.](#setup-webhook)
1. [Secure your webhook requests with verification.](#security)
</Tip>

This guide covers how to use ngrok to integrate your localhost app with Sonatype Nexus by using Webhooks.
Sonatype Nexus webhooks can be used to notify an external application whenever specific events occur in your Sonatype Nexus account.

By integrating ngrok with Sonatype Nexus, you can:

- **Develop and test Sonatype Nexus webhooks locally**, eliminating the time in deploying your development code to a public environment and setting it up in HTTPS.
- **Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Sonatype Nexus** in real-time via the inspection UI and API.
- **Modify and Replay Sonatype Nexus Webhook requests** with a single click and without spending time reproducing events manually in your Sonatype Nexus account.
- **Secure your app with Sonatype Nexus validation provided by ngrok**. Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## 1. Start your app 

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app available on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install this sample, run the following commands in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

This will get the project installed locally.

Now you can launch the app by running the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs by default on port 3000.

You can validate that the app is up and running by visiting http://localhost:3000. The application logs request headers and body in the terminal and responds with a message in the browser.

## 2. Launch ngrok 

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

1. If you're not an ngrok user yet, just [sign up for ngrok for free](https://ngrok.com/signup).

1. [Download the ngrok agent](https://download.ngrok.com).

1. Go to the [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com) and copy your Authtoken. <br />
   **Tip:** The ngrok agent uses the auth token to log into your account when you start a tunnel.
1. Start ngrok by running the following command:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

1. ngrok will display a URL where your localhost application is exposed to the internet (copy this URL for use with Sonatype Nexus).

## 3. Integrate Sonatype Nexus 

To register a webhook on your Sonatype Nexus repository follow the instructions below:

1. Access your **Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager** user interface and sign in using your administration account.
   **Tip**: The user interface URL depends on where you deployed your repository manager.

1. On the left menu, click **System**, click **Capabilities**, and then click **Create capability** on the **Capabilities** page.

1. On the **Select Capability Type** click either **Webhook: Global** or **Webhook: Repository** depending on which type of event you associate with your webhook. In this example, click **Webhook: Global**.

1. On the **Create Webhook** page, enter the URL provided by the ngrok agent to expose your application to the internet in the **URL** field (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).

1. In the **Available** list, click **repository** and then click the greater-than button to move the **repository** value to the **Selected** list.

### Run webhooks with Sonatype Nexus and ngrok

Sonatype Nexus sends different request body contents depending on the event that is being triggered.
You can trigger new calls from Sonatype Nexus to your application by following the instructions below.

1. On the **Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager** user interface, click **Repository** on the left menu and then click **Repositories**. In this example, click **apt (hosted)**.

1. On the **Repositories** page, click **Create Repository**, click one of the **Recipes** from the list, enter any value in the **Name**, **Distribution**, and **Signing Key**, and then click **Create repository**.

   Confirm your localhost app receives an event notification and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

## Secure webhook requests 

The ngrok signature webhook verification feature allows ngrok to assert that requests from your Sonatype Nexus webhook are the only traffic allowed to make calls to your localhost app.

**Note:** This ngrok feature is limited to 500 validations per month on free ngrok accounts. For unlimited, upgrade to Pro or Enterprise.

This is a quick step to add extra protection to your application.

1. Access your **Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager** user interface and sign in using your administration account.
   **Tip**: Your **Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager** URL depends on where you deployed your repository manager.

1. On the left menu, click **System**, click **Capabilities**, and then click **Webhook: Global** or **Webhook: Repository** depending on which type of capability you created before.

1. On the **Webhook** page, click the **Settings** tab, and then enter `12345` in the **Secret Key** field.

1. Create a Traffic Policy file named `sonatype_nexus_policy.yml`, replacing `{your webhook secret}` with the value of the **Secret Key** field:

   ```yaml
   on_http_request:
     - actions:
         - type: verify-webhook
           config:
             provider: sonatype_nexus
             secret: "{your webhook secret}"
   ```

1. Restart your ngrok agent by running the command:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file sonatype_nexus_policy.yml
   ```

1. On the **Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager** user interface, click **Repository** on the left menu and then click **Repositories**. In this example, click **apt (hosted)**.

1. On the **Repositories** page, click **Create Repository**, click one of the **Recipes** from the list, enter any value in the **Name**, **Distribution**, and **Signing Key**, and then click **Create repository**.

   Confirm your localhost app receives an event notification and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

Verify that your local application receives the request and logs information to the terminal.
