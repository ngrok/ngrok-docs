This guide walks you through using ngrok to receive Sonatype Nexus webhooks on your localhost app.

By integrating ngrok with Sonatype Nexus, you can:

- Develop and test Sonatype Nexus webhooks locally without deploying to a public environment or setting up HTTPS.
- Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Sonatype Nexus in real time via the inspection UI and API.
- Modify and replay Sonatype Nexus webhook requests with a single click instead of reproducing events manually in your Sonatype Nexus account.
- Secure your app with Sonatype Nexus webhook validation provided by ngrok.
  Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## What you'll need

- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup) and your [authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
- The [ngrok agent](https://ngrok.com/download) installed.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (for the sample app, or use your own app).
- A Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager instance.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install the sample, run the following in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

Then start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs on port 3000 by default.

You can confirm it's running by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
The app logs request headers and body in the terminal and shows a message in the browser.

## 2. Expose your app with ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

- Copy [your ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) from the dashboard.

<Tip>  The ngrok agent uses your authtoken to authenticate when you start a tunnel.
</Tip>

- Start ngrok:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000
  ```

- Copy the URL ngrok displays.
  Your app is now exposed at that URL for use with Sonatype Nexus.

## 3. Configure Sonatype Nexus to send webhooks

Sonatype Nexus can send webhook requests to your app when events occur in your repository.
To register for those events:

- Sign in to your **Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager** (the URL depends on where you deployed it).
- In the left menu, click **System**, **Capabilities**, and **Create capability** on the **Capabilities** page.
- Under **Select Capability Type**, choose **Webhook: Global** or **Webhook: Repository** (for this example, **Webhook: Global**).
- On **Create Webhook**, enter your ngrok URL in **URL** (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).
- In **Available**, click **repository** and use the greater-than button to move it to **Selected**.

### Run webhooks with Sonatype Nexus and ngrok

Sonatype Nexus sends different request body contents depending on the event.
To trigger a call to your app:

- In the Sonatype Nexus UI, click **Repository** and **Repositories**, then (for example) **apt (hosted)**.
- Click **Create Repository**, choose a **Recipe**, enter **Name**, **Distribution**, and **Signing Key**, and click **Create repository**.

Confirm your localhost app receives an event notification and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

## Secure webhook requests

ngrok can verify that incoming requests are from your Sonatype Nexus webhook so only that traffic reaches your app.

<Note>
  Webhook verification is limited to 500 validations per month on free accounts.
  If you need more, you can upgrade to Hobbyist or Pay-as-you-go.
  See [TPU Pricing](/pricing-limits/traffic-policy-unit-pricing/) for details.
</Note>

To add verification:

- In your **Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager**, go to **System**, **Capabilities**, and the webhook capability you created (**Webhook: Global** or **Webhook: Repository**).
- On the **Webhook** page, open the **Settings** tab and enter a value in **Secret Key** (for example, `12345`).
- Create a Traffic Policy file named `sonatype_nexus_policy.yml`.
  Replace `{your webhook secret}` with the **Secret Key** value:

  ```yaml
  on_http_request:
    - actions:
        - type: verify-webhook
          config:
            provider: sonatype_nexus
            secret: "{your webhook secret}"
  ```

- Restart ngrok with the policy file:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file sonatype_nexus_policy.yml
  ```

- Trigger an event (for example, create a repository as above) to send a request.

Your app should receive the request and log it in the terminal.
