This guide covers how to use ngrok to integrate your localhost app with Hygraph by using Webhooks.
Hygraph webhooks can be used to notify an external application whenever specific events occur in your Hygraph account.

By integrating ngrok with Hygraph, you can:

- **Develop and test Hygraph webhooks locally**, eliminating the time in deploying your development code to a public environment and setting it up in HTTPS.
- **Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Hygraph** in real-time via the inspection UI and API.
- **Modify and Replay Hygraph Webhook requests** with a single click and without spending time reproducing events manually in your Hygraph account.
- **Secure your app with Hygraph validation provided by ngrok**. Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app available on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install this sample, run the following commands in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

This will get the project installed locally.

Now you can launch the app by running the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs by default on port 3000.

You can validate that the app is up and running by visiting http://localhost:3000.
The application logs request headers and body in the terminal and responds with a message in the browser.

## 2. Launch ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

1. If you're not an ngrok user yet, just [sign up for ngrok for free](https://ngrok.com/signup).

1. [Download the ngrok agent](https://download.ngrok.com).

1. Go to the [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com) and copy your Authtoken. <br />
   **Tip:** The ngrok agent uses the auth token to log into your account when you start a tunnel.
1. Start ngrok by running the following command:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

1. ngrok will display a URL where your localhost application is exposed to the internet (copy this URL for use with Hygraph).

## 3. Integrate Hygraph

To register a webhook on your Hygraph account follow the instructions below:

1. Access [Hygraph](https://app.hygraph.com/) and sign in using your Hygraph account.

1. On the left menu, click **Webhooks** and then click **Add Webhook**.

1. On the webhook popup, enter a name in the **Name** field and enter the URL provided by the ngrok agent to expose your application to the internet in the **URL** field (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).

1. Select **Asset** in the **Content Model** field and then click **Add** at the top of the popup screen.

### Run webhooks with Hygraph and ngrok

Hygraph sends different request body contents depending on the event that is being triggered.
You can trigger new calls from Hygraph to your application by following the instructions below.

1. On the Hygraph home page, click **Assets** and then click **+ Add entry**.

1. On the **Assets** page, click **Upload**, select a file from your desktop, click **Upload**, and then click **Save & Publish**.

   Confirm your localhost app receives event notifications and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

   Alternatively, you can verify the log of the webhook call in Hygraph: 1.
   On the left menu, click **Webhooks** and then click **View Logs** for your webhook, and then click one of the messages. ![Webhook Logs](../img/hygraph/ngrok_logs_hygraph.png)

## Secure webhook requests

The ngrok signature webhook verification feature allows ngrok to assert that requests from your Hygraph webhook are the only traffic allowed to make calls to your localhost app.

**Note:** This ngrok feature is limited to 500 validations per month on free ngrok accounts. For unlimited, upgrade to Pro or Enterprise.

This is a quick step to add extra protection to your application.

1. Access [Hygraph](https://app.hygraph.com/) and sign in using your Hygraph account.

1. On the left menu, click **Webhooks**, and click the pencil icon in your webhook tile.

1. On the popup, enter a secret key that is at least 32 characters long in the **Secret key** field, and then click **Update** at the top of the popup screen.

1. Create a Traffic Policy file named `hygraph_policy.yml`, replacing `{your secret key}` with the value you used in the **Secret key** field:

   ```yaml
   on_http_request:
     - name: "Verify Hygraph requests"
       actions:
         - type: verify-webhook
           config:
             provider: "graphcms"
             secret: "{your secret key}"
   ```

1. Restart your ngrok agent by running the command:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file hygraph_policy.yml
   ```

1. On the Hygraph home page, create a new asset.

Verify that your local application receives the request and logs information to the terminal.
