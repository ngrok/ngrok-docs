This guide walks you through using ngrok to receive PagerDuty webhooks on your localhost app.

By integrating ngrok with PagerDuty, you can:

- Develop and test PagerDuty webhooks locally without deploying to a public environment or setting up HTTPS.
- Inspect and troubleshoot requests from PagerDuty in real time via the inspection UI and API.
- Modify and replay PagerDuty webhook requests with a single click instead of reproducing events manually in your PagerDuty account.
- Secure your app with PagerDuty webhook validation provided by ngrok.
  Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## What you'll need

- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup) and your [authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
- The [ngrok agent](https://ngrok.com/download) installed.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (for the sample app, or use your own app).
- A PagerDuty account.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install the sample, run the following in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

Then start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs on port 3000 by default.

You can confirm it's running by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
The app logs request headers and body in the terminal and shows a message in the browser.

## 2. Expose your app with ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

- Copy [your ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) from the dashboard.

<Tip>
  The ngrok agent uses your authtoken to authenticate when you start a tunnel.
</Tip>

- Start ngrok:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000
  ```

- Copy the URL ngrok displays.
  Your app is now exposed at that URL for use with PagerDuty.

## 3. Configure PagerDuty to send webhooks

PagerDuty can send webhook requests to your app when events occur in your account.
To register for those events:

- Sign in to [PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/).
- Click **Integrations** and then **Generic Webhooks**.
- On **Your Webhooks**, click **+ New Webhook** for your application.
- On **New Webhook**, enter your ngrok URL in **WEBHOOK URL** (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).
- Select **Service** as **SCOPE TYPE**, select a service for **SCOPE**, click **Select all** under **EVENT SUBSCRIPTION**, and click **Add Webhook**.
- In the **Webhook subscription created** popup, click **Copy** to copy the webhook payload signing secret for verification, then click **OK**.
- Click your new webhook, scroll to **Test**, click **Send Test Event**, and **Yes, Send Event**.

Confirm your localhost app receives the test event and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

### Run webhooks with PagerDuty and ngrok

PagerDuty sends different request body contents depending on the event.
To trigger new calls from PagerDuty to your app:

- Go to **Services** and **Service Directory**, then **+ New Service**.
- Create a service (click **Next** until **Integrations**, then **Create service without an integration**).
- On the service page, click **New Incident**, select your service, enter a title, set **Urgency** to **Low**, and click **Create Incident**.

Confirm your localhost app receives the incident event and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

## Secure webhook requests

ngrok can verify that incoming requests are from your PagerDuty webhook so only that traffic reaches your app.

<Note>
  Webhook verification is limited to 500 validations per month on free accounts.
  If you need more, you can upgrade to Hobbyist or Pay-as-you-go.
  See [TPU Pricing](/pricing-limits/traffic-policy-unit-pricing/) for details.
</Note>

To add verification:

- Create a Traffic Policy file named `pagerduty_policy.yml`.
  Replace `{your webhook payload signing}` with the value you copied when creating the webhook:

  ```yaml
  on_http_request:
    - actions:
        - type: verify-webhook
          config:
            provider: pagerduty
            secret: "{your webhook payload signing}"
  ```

- Restart ngrok with the policy file:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file pagerduty_policy.yml
  ```

- Create a new incident in PagerDuty to trigger the webhook.

Your app should receive the request and log it in the terminal.
