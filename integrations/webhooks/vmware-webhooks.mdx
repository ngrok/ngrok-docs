This guide shows you how to use ngrok to receive VMware Workspace ONE webhooks on your localhost app.

By integrating ngrok with VMware Workspace ONE, you can:

- Develop and test VMware Workspace ONE webhooks locally without deploying to a public environment or setting up HTTPS.
- Inspect and troubleshoot requests from VMware Workspace ONE in real time via the inspection UI and API.
- Modify and replay VMware Workspace ONE webhook requests with a single click instead of reproducing events manually in your VMware Workspace ONE account.
- Secure your app with VMware Workspace ONE webhook validation provided by ngrok.
  Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## What you'll need

- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup) and your [authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
- The [ngrok agent](https://ngrok.com/download) installed.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (for the sample app, or use your own app).
- A VMware Workspace ONE account.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install the sample, run the following in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

Then start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs on port 3000 by default.

You can confirm it's running by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
The app logs request headers and body in the terminal and shows a message in the browser.

## 2. Expose your app with ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

- Copy [your ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) from the dashboard.

<Tip>
  The ngrok agent uses your authtoken to authenticate when you start a tunnel.
</Tip>

- Start ngrok:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000
  ```

- Copy the URL ngrok displays.
  Your app is now exposed at that URL for use with VMware Workspace ONE.

## 3. Configure VMware Workspace ONE to send webhooks

VMware Workspace ONE can send webhook requests to your app when events occur in Workspace ONE UEM.
To register for those events:

- Sign in to [VMware Workspace ONE](https://console.cloud.vmware.com/).
- Click **LAUNCH SERVICE** for **Workspace ONE**, then **MANAGE** for **Unified Endpoint Management**.
- Go to **GROUPS & SETTINGS** > **All Settings** > **Advanced** (System) > **API** > **Event Notifications**.
- On **Event Notifications**, select **Override** and click **ADD RULE**.
- In **Add Event Notification**, enter a **Target Name** (for example, `My Webhook`) and your ngrok URL in **Target URL** (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).
- Choose **JSON** as **Format**, click **TEST CONNECTION**, and confirm your app receives the request and "Test is successful" appears.
- In **Events**, set **ENABLED** for the events you want and click **SAVE**.

### Run webhooks with VMware Workspace ONE and ngrok

To trigger events (e.g. device enrollment):

- In Workspace ONE, go to **DEVICES** > **List View** > **ADD DEVICE**.
- Select a user, enter a valid **Email address** in **Messaging**, and click **SAVE** (create a user if needed).
- The user receives an activation email; opening the link and enrolling the device triggers events.

Confirm your localhost app receives notifications and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

## Secure webhook requests

ngrok can verify that incoming requests are from your VMware Workspace ONE webhook so only that traffic reaches your app.

<Note>
  Webhook verification is limited to 500 validations per month on free accounts.
  If you need more, you can upgrade to Hobbyist or Pay-as-you-go.
  See [TPU Pricing](/pricing-limits/traffic-policy-unit-pricing/) for details.
</Note>

To add verification:

- In [VMware Workspace ONE](https://console.cloud.vmware.com/), go to **Event Notifications** (as above), click your webhook, and **EDIT**.
- On **Edit Event Notification**, enter **Username** and **Password** (and **Confirm Password**), then click **SAVE**.
- Create a Traffic Policy file named `vmware_policy.yml`.
  Replace `{username}` and `{password}` with the values you set:

  ```yaml
  on_http_request:
    - actions:
        - type: verify-webhook
          config:
            provider: vmware_workspace
            secret: "{username}::{password}"
  ```

- Restart ngrok with the policy file:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file vmware_policy.yml
  ```

- Trigger an event again (e.g. device enrollment) to send a request.

Your app should receive the request and log it in the terminal.
