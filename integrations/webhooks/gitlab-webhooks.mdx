<Tip>
**TL;DR**



To integrate GitLab webhooks with ngrok:

1. [Launch your local webhook.](#start-your-app) `npm start`
1. [Launch ngrok.](#start-ngrok) `ngrok http 3000`
1. [Configure GitLab webhooks with your ngrok URL.](#setup-webhook)
1. [Secure your webhook requests with verification.](#security)
</Tip>

This guide covers how to use ngrok to integrate your localhost app with GitLab to allow GitLab to send notifications to your app anytime an event takes place in a GitLab repository.

By integrating ngrok with GitLab, you can:

- **Develop and test GitLab webhooks locally**, eliminating the time in deploying your development code to a public environment and setting it up in HTTPS.
- **Inspect and troubleshoot requests from GitLab** in real-time via the inspection UI and API.
- **Modify and Replay GitLab Webhook requests** with a single click and without spending time reproducing events manually in your GitLab account.
- **Secure your app with GitLab validation provided by ngrok**. Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## 1. Start your app 

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app available on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install this sample, run the following commands in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

This will get the project installed locally.

Now you can launch the app by running the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs by default on port 3000.

You can validate that the app is up and running by visiting http://localhost:3000. The application logs request headers and body in the terminal and responds with a message in the browser.

## 2. Launch ngrok 

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

1. If you're not an ngrok user yet, just [sign up for ngrok for free](https://ngrok.com/signup).

1. [Download the ngrok agent](https://download.ngrok.com).

1. Go to the [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com) and copy your Authtoken. <br />
   **Tip:** The ngrok agent uses the auth token to log into your account when you start a tunnel.
1. Start ngrok by running the following command:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

1. ngrok will display a URL where your localhost application is exposed to the internet (copy this URL for use with GitLab).

## 3. Integrate GitLab 

GitLab can trigger webhook calls to external applications whenever events happen in a repository. To register for such events, follow the instructions below:

1. Sign in to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com).

1. Select a repository from the **Your Repository** list.
   **Tip:** If you don't have a repository, create a new empty one.

1. In the repository page, click **Settings** from the left menu and then click **Webhooks**.

1. On the **Webhooks** page, in the **URL** field enter the URL provided by the ngrok agent to expose your application to the internet (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).
   ![URL](../img/gitlab/img/ngrok_url_configuration_gitlab.png)

1. Mark the **Push events** checkbox under the **Trigger** section and then click **Add webhook**.

1. On the **Webhooks** page, scroll down until the **Project Hooks** section appears.

1. In the webhook list for the **Project Hooks** section, click **Test** for the webhook you've just created and then click **Push events**.

   Confirm your localhost app receives the test event notification and logs both headers and body to the terminal.

1. Optionally, in the webhook list, click the **Edit** button for your webhook entry, scroll down the webhook page until the **Recent events** section appears, and then click **View details** for the **Push Hook** trigger line to verify information about the post request GitLab has sent to your localhost application.

   Verify the content of the request is the same as the content received by your localhost app.

### Run webhooks with GitLab and ngrok

Because you've selected the **Push event** as the trigger for your webhook, GitLab will submit a post request to your application through ngrok whenever you push content to your repository.
**Note:** Different messages are sent to your application depending on the trigger event you choose.

Follow the instructions below to add some content to your repository:

1. Click the name of your repository at the top of the left menu.

1. On the project's page, click **+** and then click **New file**.

1. In the **New file** page, enter a name for the file in the **File name** field, and enter the following content to the file in the textbox:
   `This is my file content`.

1. Click **Commit changes**.

   Confirm your localhost app receives the push event notification and logs both headers and body to the terminal.

Alternatively, clone your repository locally, add some content, commit, and then push the content to your repostiory on GitLab:
`git add .; git commit -m "my first commit"; git push`

## Secure webhook requests 

The ngrok signature webhook verification feature allows ngrok to assert that requests from your Gitlab webhooks are the only traffic allowed to make calls to your localhost app.

**Note:** This ngrok feature is limited to 500 validations per month on free ngrok accounts. For unlimited, upgrade to Pro or Enterprise.

This is a quick step to add extra protection to your application.

1. In the repository page, click **Settings** from the left menu and then click **Webhooks**.

1. In the **Webhooks** page, scroll down until the **Project Hooks** section appears, and then click **Edit** for your webhook.

1. Enter a text for the **Secret token** field and click **Save changes**.

1. Create a Traffic Policy file named `gitlab_policy.yml`, replacing `{your secret token}` with the value you have provided to the **Secret token** field (See [Integrate GitLab](#setup-webhook)):

   ```yaml
   - on_http_request:
       - actions:
           - type: verify-webhook
         config:
           provider: gitlab
           secret: "{your secret token}"
   ```

1. Restart your ngrok agent by running the command:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file gitlab_policy.yml
   ```

1. In the **Project Hooks** section, click **Test** for your webhook, and then click **Push events**. Alternatively, push content to your repository.

Verify that your local application receives the request and logs information to the terminal.
