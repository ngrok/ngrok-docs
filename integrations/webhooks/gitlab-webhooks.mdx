This guide explains how to use ngrok to receive GitLab webhooks on your localhost app.

By integrating ngrok with GitLab, you can:

- Develop and test GitLab webhooks locally without deploying to a public environment or setting up HTTPS.
- Inspect and troubleshoot requests from GitLab in real time via the inspection UI and API.
- Modify and replay GitLab webhook requests with a single click instead of reproducing events manually in your GitLab account.
- Secure your app with GitLab webhook validation provided by ngrok.
  Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## What you'll need

- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup) and your [authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
- The [ngrok agent](https://ngrok.com/download) installed.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (for the sample app, or use your own app).
- A GitLab account.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install the sample, run the following in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

Then start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs on port 3000 by default.

You can confirm it's running by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
The app logs request headers and body in the terminal and shows a message in the browser.

## 2. Expose your app with ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

- Copy [your ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) from the dashboard.

<Tip>
  The ngrok agent uses your authtoken to authenticate when you start a tunnel.
</Tip>

- Start ngrok:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000
  ```

- Copy the URL ngrok displays.
  Your app is now exposed at that URL for use with GitLab.

## 3. Configure GitLab to send webhooks

GitLab can send webhook requests to your app when events occur in a repository.
To register for those events:

- Sign in to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com).
- Select a repository from the **Your Repository** list.

<Note>
  If you don't have a repository, create a new empty one.
</Note>

- In the repository, click **Settings** and then **Webhooks**.
- On the **Webhooks** page, enter your ngrok URL in the **URL** field (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).
- Check **Push events** under **Trigger** and click **Add webhook**.
- Scroll to the **Project Hooks** section, click **Test** for your webhook, and then click **Push events**.

Confirm your localhost app receives the test event and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

You can verify the request in GitLab: click **Edit** for your webhook, scroll to **Recent events**, and click **View details** for the **Push Hook** line.

### Run webhooks with GitLab and ngrok

With **Push events** as the trigger, GitLab sends a post request to your app when you push to the repository.
To trigger a call:

- Click your repository name at the top of the left menu.
- On the project page, click **+** and then **New file**.
- On the **New file** page, enter a **File name** and add content (for example, `This is my file content`).
- Click **Commit changes**.

Confirm your localhost app receives the push event and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

Alternatively, clone the repository locally, add and commit changes, then push: `git add .; git commit -m "my first commit"; git push`

## Secure webhook requests

ngrok can verify that incoming requests are from your GitLab webhook so only that traffic reaches your app.

<Note>
  Webhook verification is limited to 500 validations per month on free accounts.
  If you need more, you can upgrade to Hobbyist or Pay-as-you-go.
  See [TPU Pricing](/pricing-limits/traffic-policy-unit-pricing/) for details.
</Note>

To add verification:

- In your repository, go to **Settings** and **Webhooks**, scroll to **Project Hooks**, and click **Edit** for your webhook.
- Enter a value in the **Secret token** field and click **Save changes**.
- Create a Traffic Policy file named `gitlab_policy.yml`.
  Replace `{your secret token}` with the value you entered:

  ```yaml
  on_http_request:
    - actions:
        - type: verify-webhook
          config:
            provider: gitlab
            secret: "{your secret token}"
  ```

- Restart ngrok with the policy file:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file gitlab_policy.yml
  ```

- In **Project Hooks**, click **Test** and then **Push events**, or push content to your repository.

Your app should receive the request and log it in the terminal.
