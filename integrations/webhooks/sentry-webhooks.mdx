This guide shows you how to use ngrok to receive Sentry webhooks on your localhost app.

By integrating ngrok with Sentry, you can:

- Develop and test Sentry webhooks locally without deploying to a public environment or setting up HTTPS.
- Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Sentry in real time via the inspection UI and API.
- Modify and replay Sentry webhook requests with a single click instead of reproducing events manually in your Sentry account.
- Secure your app with Sentry webhook validation provided by ngrok.
  Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## What you'll need

- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup) and your [authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
- The [ngrok agent](https://ngrok.com/download) installed.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (for the sample app, or use your own app).
- A Sentry account.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install the sample, run the following in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

Then start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs on port 3000 by default.

You can confirm it's running by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
The app logs request headers and body in the terminal and shows a message in the browser.

## 2. Expose your app with ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

- Copy [your ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) from the dashboard.

<Tip>
  The ngrok agent uses your authtoken to authenticate when you start a tunnel.
</Tip>

- Start ngrok:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000
  ```

- Copy the URL ngrok displays.
  Your app is now exposed at that URL for use with Sentry.

## 3. Configure Sentry to send webhooks

Sentry can send webhook requests to your app when events occur in your projects.
To register for those events:

- Sign in to [Sentry](https://sentry.io/).
- Click **Settings**, **Developer Settings** (under Organization), and **Create new integration**.
- On **Choose Integration Type**, select **Internal Integration** and click **Next**.
- On **Create Internal Integration**, enter a name in **Name** (for example, `My Local App Webhook`) and your ngrok URL in **Webhook URL** (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).
- Under **PERMISSIONS**, set **Issue & Event** to **Read & Write**, check **issue** under **WEBHOOKS**, and click **Save Changes**.

### Run webhooks with Sentry and ngrok

Sentry sends different request body contents depending on the event.
To trigger new calls from Sentry to your app:

- Click **Issues** and open an issue (or **Create a sample event** if you have none).
- Click **Resolve**.

Confirm your localhost app receives the notification and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

You can verify in Sentry: **Settings**, **Developer Settings**, then your integration and **Dashboard**.

## Secure webhook requests

ngrok can verify that incoming requests are from your Sentry webhook so only that traffic reaches your app.

<Note>
  Webhook verification is limited to 500 validations per month on free accounts.
  If you need more, you can upgrade to Hobbyist or Pay-as-you-go.
  See [TPU Pricing](/pricing-limits/traffic-policy-unit-pricing/) for details.
</Note>

To add verification:

- In [Sentry](https://sentry.io/), go to **Settings**, **Developer Settings**, and your integration.
- Under **CREDENTIALS**, copy the **Client Secret** value.
- Create a Traffic Policy file named `sentry_policy.yml`.
  Replace `{your client secret}` with the value you copied:

  ```yaml
  on_http_request:
    - actions:
        - type: verify-webhook
          config:
            provider: sentry
            secret: "{your client secret}"
  ```

- Restart ngrok with the policy file:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file sentry_policy.yml
  ```

- Resolve an issue or trigger another event in Sentry to send a request.

Your app should receive the request and log it in the terminal.
