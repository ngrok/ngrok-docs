This guide covers how to use ngrok to integrate your localhost app with Frame.io by using Webhooks.
Frame.io webhooks can be used to notify an external application whenever specific events occur in your Frame.io account.

By integrating ngrok with Frame.io, you can:

- **Develop and test Frame.io webhooks locally**, eliminating the time in deploying your development code to a public environment and setting it up in HTTPS.
- **Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Frame.io** in real-time via the inspection UI and API.
- **Modify and Replay Frame.io Webhook requests** with a single click and without spending time reproducing events manually in your Frame.io account.
- **Secure your app with Frame.io validation provided by ngrok**. Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app available on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install this sample, run the following commands in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

This will get the project installed locally.

Now you can launch the app by running the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs by default on port 3000.

You can validate that the app is up and running by visiting http://localhost:3000.
The application logs request headers and body in the terminal and responds with a message in the browser.

## 2. Launch ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

1. If you're not an ngrok user yet, just [sign up for ngrok for free](https://ngrok.com/signup).

1. [Download the ngrok agent](https://download.ngrok.com).

1. Go to the [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com) and copy your Authtoken. <br />
   **Tip:** The ngrok agent uses the auth token to log into your account when you start a tunnel.
1. Start ngrok by running the following command:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

1. ngrok will display a URL where your localhost application is exposed to the internet (copy this URL for use with Frame.io).

## 3. Integrate Frame.io

To register a webhook on your Frame.io account follow the instructions below:

1. Access [Frame.io](https://frame.io/) and sign in using your Frame.io account.

1. In the same browser, access [Frame.io Developer](https://developer.frame.io/).

1. On the top menu of the developer site, click **DEVELOPER TOOLS** and then click **Webhooks**.

1. On the **Webhooks** page, click **Create a Webhook**.

1. On the **Create a new webhook** page, enter a name in the **NAME** field, and in the **URL** field enter the URL provided by the ngrok agent to expose your application to the internet (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).

1. Select your team for the **TEAM** field, click the **created** checkbox for **Projects** under the **EVENTS** section, and then click **Submit**.

### Run webhooks with Frame.io and ngrok

Frame.io sends different request body contents depending on the event that is being triggered.
You can trigger new calls from Frame.io to your application by following the instructions below.

1. In the same browser, access [Frame.io](https://frame.io/), and then click **+** close to your team name on the left menu.

1. On the **New Project** popup, enter a project name and then click **Create Project**.

   Confirm your localhost app receives the create-project event notification and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

Optionally, you can verify the log of the webhook call in Frame.io:

1. In the same browser, access [Frame.io Developer](https://developer.frame.io/).

1. On the top menu of the developer site, click **DEVELOPER TOOLS** and then click **Webhooks**.

1. On the **Webhooks** page, click **View logs** close to your webhook.

1. On the **Webhook Logs** page, click **View details** and confirm
   ![Webhook Logs](../img/frameio/ngrok_logs_frameio.png)

<InspectingRequests />

<ReplayingRequests />
## Secure webhook requests

The ngrok signature webhook verification feature allows ngrok to assert that requests from your Frame.io webhook are the only traffic allowed to make calls to your localhost app.

**Note:** This ngrok feature is limited to 500 validations per month on free ngrok accounts. For unlimited, upgrade to Pro or Enterprise.

This is a quick step to add extra protection to your application.

1. Access [Frame.io Developer](https://developer.frame.io/).

1. On the top menu of the developer site, click **DEVELOPER TOOLS** and then click **Webhooks**.

1. On the **Webhooks** page, click **Copy** to copy the **Secret** value.

1. Create a Traffic Policy file named `frameio_policy.yml`, replacing `{your webhook secret}` with the value you have copied before (See [Integrate ngrok and Frame.io.](#setup-webhook)):

   ```yaml
   on_http_request:
     - name: "Verify Frame.io requests"
       actions:
         - type: verify-webhook
           config:
             provider: "frameio"
             secret: "{your webhook secret}"
   ```

1. Restart your ngrok agent by running the command:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file frameio_policy.yml
   ```

1. Access [Frame.io](https://frame.io/) and create a new project.

Verify that your local application receives the request and logs information to the terminal.
