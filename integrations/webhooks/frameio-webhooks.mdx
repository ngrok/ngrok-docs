This guide walks you through using ngrok to receive Frame.io webhooks on your localhost app.

By integrating ngrok with Frame.io, you can:

- Develop and test Frame.io webhooks locally without deploying to a public environment or setting up HTTPS.
- Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Frame.io in real time via the inspection UI and API.
- Modify and replay Frame.io webhook requests with a single click instead of reproducing events manually in your Frame.io account.
- Secure your app with Frame.io webhook validation provided by ngrok.
  Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## What you'll need

- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup) and your [authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
- The [ngrok agent](https://ngrok.com/download) installed.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (for the sample app, or use your own app).
- A Frame.io account.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install the sample, run the following in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

Then start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs on port 3000 by default.

You can confirm it's running by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
The app logs request headers and body in the terminal and shows a message in the browser.

## 2. Expose your app with ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

- Copy [your ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) from the dashboard.

<Tip>  The ngrok agent uses your authtoken to authenticate when you start a tunnel.
</Tip>

- Start ngrok:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000
  ```

- Copy the URL ngrok displays.
  Your app is now exposed at that URL for use with Frame.io.

## 3. Configure Frame.io to send webhooks

Frame.io can send webhook requests to your app when events occur in your account.
To register for those events:

- Sign in to [Frame.io](https://frame.io/) and open [Frame.io Developer](https://developer.frame.io/) in the same browser.
- On the developer site, click **DEVELOPER TOOLS** and then **Webhooks**.
- On the **Webhooks** page, click **Create a Webhook**.
- On **Create a new webhook**, enter a name in **NAME**, enter your ngrok URL in the **URL** field (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).
- Select your team in **TEAM**, check **created** for **Projects** under **EVENTS**, and click **Submit**.

### Run webhooks with Frame.io and ngrok

Frame.io sends different request body contents depending on the event.
To trigger new calls from Frame.io to your app:

- In [Frame.io](https://frame.io/), click **+** next to your team name in the left menu.
- On the **New Project** popup, enter a project name and click **Create Project**.

Confirm your localhost app receives the create-project event and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

You can verify the webhook in Frame.io: in [Frame.io Developer](https://developer.frame.io/), go to **DEVELOPER TOOLS**, **Webhooks**, click **View logs** next to your webhook, and then **View details** on the **Webhook Logs** page.

## Secure webhook requests

ngrok can verify that incoming requests are from your Frame.io webhook so only that traffic reaches your app.

<Note>
  Webhook verification is limited to 500 validations per month on free accounts.
  If you need more, you can upgrade to Hobbyist or Pay-as-you-go.
  See [TPU Pricing](/pricing-limits/traffic-policy-unit-pricing/) for details.
</Note>

To add verification:

- In [Frame.io Developer](https://developer.frame.io/), go to **DEVELOPER TOOLS** and **Webhooks**, then click **Copy** to copy the **Secret** value.
- Create a Traffic Policy file named `frameio_policy.yml`.
  Replace `{your webhook secret}` with the value you copied:

  ```yaml
  on_http_request:
    - actions:
        - type: verify-webhook
          config:
            provider: frameio
            secret: "{your webhook secret}"
  ```

- Restart ngrok with the policy file:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file frameio_policy.yml
  ```

- Create a new project in Frame.io to trigger the webhook.

Your app should receive the request and log it in the terminal.
