<Tip>
**TL;DR**

To integrate AfterShip webhooks with ngrok:

1. [Launch your local webhook.](#start-your-app) `npm start`
1. [Launch ngrok.](#start-ngrok) `ngrok http 3000`
1. [Configure AfterShip webhooks with your ngrok URL.](#setup-webhook)
1. [Secure your webhook requests with verification.](#security)
   </Tip>

This guide covers how to use ngrok to integrate your localhost app with AfterShip by using Webhooks.
AfterShip webhooks can be used to notify an external application whenever specific events occur in your AfterShip account.

By integrating ngrok with AfterShip, you can:

- **Develop and test AfterShip webhooks locally**, eliminating the time in deploying your development code to a public environment and setting it up in HTTPS.
- **Inspect and troubleshoot requests from AfterShip** in real-time via the inspection UI and API.
- **Modify and Replay AfterShip Webhook requests** with a single click and without spending time reproducing events manually in your AfterShip account.
- **Secure your app with AfterShip validation provided by ngrok**. Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, we'll use the [sample NodeJS app available on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install this sample, run the following commands in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

This will get the project installed locally.

Now you can launch the app by running the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs by default on port 3000.

You can validate that the app is up and running by visiting http://localhost:3000. The application logs request headers and body in the terminal and responds with a message in the browser.

## 2. Launch ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

1. If you're not an ngrok user yet, just [sign up for ngrok for free](https://ngrok.com/signup).

1. [Download the ngrok agent](https://download.ngrok.com).

1. Go to the [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com) and copy your Authtoken. <br />
   **Tip:** The ngrok agent uses the auth token to log into your account when you start a tunnel.
1. Start ngrok by running the following command:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

1. ngrok will display a URL where your localhost application is exposed to the internet (copy this URL for use with AfterShip).

## 3. Integrate AfterShip

To register a webhook on your AfterShip account follow the instructions below:

1. Access [AfterShip](https://www.aftership.com/) and sign in using your AfterShip account.

1. On the left menu, click **Notifications** and then click **Webhooks**.

1. On the **Webhooks** page, click **Add webhook URL**.

1. On the **Add webhook URL** popup, enter the URL provided by the ngrok agent to expose your application to the internet in the **Webhook URL** field (that is, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).

1. Click **Save**.

   Confirm your localhost app receives a notification and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

### Run Webhooks with AfterShip and ngrok

AfterShip sends different request body contents depending on the status of the shipments created in your account.
You can trigger new calls from AfterShip to your application by following the instructions below.

1. On the [AfterShip console](https://admin.aftership.com/), click **Shipments** on the left menu and then click **Add shipment**.

1. On the **Add new shipment** page, enter a tracking number in the **Tracking no.** field and then click **Save shipment**. Optionally, you can fill in all fields on this page.

   Confirm your localhost app receives an event notification and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

## Secure webhook requests

The ngrok signature webhook verification feature allows ngrok to assert that requests from your AfterShip webhook are the only traffic allowed to make calls to your localhost app.

**Note:** This ngrok feature is limited to 500 validations per month on free ngrok accounts. For unlimited, upgrade to Pro or Enterprise.

This is a quick step to add extra protection to your application.

1. Access [AfterShip](https://www.aftership.com/) and sign in using your AfterShip account.

1. On the left menu, click **Notifications** and then click **Webhooks**.

1. On the **Webhooks** page, copy the value of the **Webhook secret**.

1. Create a traffic policy file named `aftership_policy.yml`, replacing `{your webhook secret}` with the value you have copied before (See [Integrate ngrok and AfterShip.](#setup-webhook)):

   ```yaml
   on_http_request:
     - actions:
         - type: verify-webhook
           config:
             provider: aftership
             secret: "{your webhook secret}"
   ```

1. Restart your ngrok agent by running the command:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file aftership_policy.yml
   ```

1. Access [AfterShip](https://www.aftership.com/) and create a new shipment.

Verify that your local application receives the request and logs information to the terminal.
