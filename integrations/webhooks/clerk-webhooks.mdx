This guide covers how to use ngrok to integrate your localhost app with Clerk by using Webhooks.
Clerk webhooks can be used to notify an external application whenever specific events occur in your Clerk account.

By integrating ngrok with Clerk, you can:

- **Develop and test Clerk webhooks locally**, eliminating the time in deploying your development code to a public environment and setting it up in HTTPS.
- **Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Clerk** in real-time via the inspection UI and API.
- **Modify and Replay Clerk Webhook requests** with a single click and without spending time reproducing events manually in your Clerk account.
- **Secure your app with Clerk validation provided by ngrok**. Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app available on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install this sample, run the following commands in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

This will get the project installed locally.

Now you can launch the app by running the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs by default on port 3000.

You can validate that the app is up and running by visiting http://localhost:3000.
The application logs request headers and body in the terminal and responds with a message in the browser.

## 2. Launch ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

1. If you're not an ngrok user yet, just [sign up for ngrok for free](https://ngrok.com/signup).

1. [Download the ngrok agent](https://download.ngrok.com).

1. Go to the [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com) and copy your Authtoken. <br />
   **Tip:** The ngrok agent uses the auth token to log into your account when you start a tunnel.
1. Start ngrok by running the following command:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

1. ngrok will display a URL where your localhost application is exposed to the internet (copy this URL for use with Clerk).

## 3. Integrate Clerk

To register a webhook on your Clerk account follow the instructions below:

1. Access the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/sign-in) and sign in using your Clerk account.

1. On the **Applications** page, click your application and then click **Webhook** on the left menu.
   **Tip**: If you don`t have an application click **Add application** to create one.

1. On the **Webhooks** page, click **Add Endpoint** and then enter the URL provided by the ngrok agent to expose your application to the internet in the **Endpoint URL** field (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).
   ![Clerk Endpoint URL](../img/clerk/ngrok_url_configuration_clerk.png)

1. In the **Message Filtering** section, select **user.created**, **user.deleted**, and **user.updated** under **Filter events**.

1. Click **Create**.

1. On the **Endpoints** page, click the **Testing** tab, select **user.created** in the **Send event** field, and then click **Send Example**.

   Confirm your localhost app receives the event notification and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

### Run webhooks with Clerk and ngrok

Clerk sends different request body contents depending on the event that is being triggered.
You can trigger new calls from Clerk to your application by following the instructions below.

1. On the left menu of the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/sign-in), click **+Users** and then click **CREATE**.

1. On the **Create User** popup, enter an email and a password for the user and then click **CREATE**.

   Confirm your localhost app receives the event notification and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

Alternatively, you can verify the log of the webhook call in Clerk:

1. On the left menu of the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/sign-in), click **+Webhooks** and then click the **Logs** tab.
   ![Webhook Logs](../img/clerk/ngrok_logs_clerk.png)

1. Click one of the messages to see its details.

## Secure webhook requests

The ngrok signature webhook verification feature allows ngrok to assert that requests from your Clerk webhook are the only traffic allowed to make calls to your localhost app.

**Note:** This ngrok feature is limited to 500 validations per month on free ngrok accounts.
For unlimited, upgrade to Pro or Enterprise.

This is a quick step to add extra protection to your application.

1. Access the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/sign-in), click **Webhooks** on the left menu, and then click your endpoint in the list of endpoints.

1. On the **Endpoint** page, click the eye icon under **Signing Secret** and copy the value that appears.

1. Create a Traffic Policy file named `clerk_policy.yml`, replacing `{endpoint signing secret}` with the value you copied before:

   ```yaml
   on_http_request:
     - actions:
         - type: verify-webhook
           config:
             provider: clerk
             secret: "{endpoint signing secret}"
   ```

1. Restart your ngrok agent by running the command:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file clerk_policy.yml
   ```

1. Click **Users** on the left menu and then create a new user.

Verify that your local application receives the request and logs information to the terminal.
