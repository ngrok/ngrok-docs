This guide walks you through using ngrok to receive Clerk webhooks on your localhost app.

By integrating ngrok with Clerk, you can:

- Develop and test Clerk webhooks locally without deploying to a public environment or setting up HTTPS.
- Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Clerk in real time via the inspection UI and API.
- Modify and replay Clerk webhook requests with a single click instead of reproducing events manually in your Clerk account.
- Secure your app with Clerk webhook validation provided by ngrok.
  Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## What you'll need

- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup) and your [authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
- The [ngrok agent](https://ngrok.com/download) installed.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (for the sample app, or use your own app).
- A Clerk account.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install the sample, run the following in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

Then start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs on port 3000 by default.

You can confirm it's running by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
The app logs request headers and body in the terminal and shows a message in the browser.

## 2. Expose your app with ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

- Copy [your ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) from the dashboard.

<Tip>  The ngrok agent uses your authtoken to authenticate when you start a tunnel.
</Tip>

- Start ngrok:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000
  ```

- Copy the URL ngrok displays.
  Your app is now exposed at that URL for use with Clerk.

## 3. Configure Clerk to send webhooks

Clerk can send webhook requests to your app when events occur in your account.
To register for those events:

- Sign in to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/sign-in).
- On the **Applications** page, click your application and then click **Webhook** in the left menu.

<Note>  If you don't have an application, click **Add application** to create one.
</Note>

- On the **Webhooks** page, click **Add Endpoint** and enter your ngrok URL in the **Endpoint URL** field (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).
- In **Message Filtering**, select **user.created**, **user.deleted**, and **user.updated** under **Filter events**.
- Click **Create**.
- On the **Endpoints** page, click the **Testing** tab, select **user.created** in **Send event**, and click **Send Example**.

Confirm your localhost app receives the event and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

### Run webhooks with Clerk and ngrok

Clerk sends different request body contents depending on the event.
To trigger new calls from Clerk to your app:

- In the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/sign-in), click **+Users** and then **CREATE**.
- On the **Create User** popup, enter an email and password and click **CREATE**.

Confirm your localhost app receives the event and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

You can also check the webhook in Clerk: click **+Webhooks** and then the **Logs** tab.

## Secure webhook requests

ngrok can verify that incoming requests are from your Clerk webhook so only that traffic reaches your app.

<Note>
  Webhook verification is limited to 500 validations per month on free accounts.
  If you need more, you can upgrade to Hobbyist or Pay-as-you-go.
  See [TPU Pricing](/pricing-limits/traffic-policy-unit-pricing/) for details.
</Note>

To add verification:

- In the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/sign-in), go to **Webhooks** and click your endpoint.
- On the **Endpoint** page, click the eye icon under **Signing Secret** and copy the value.
- Create a Traffic Policy file named `clerk_policy.yml`.
  Replace `{endpoint signing secret}` with the value you copied:

  ```yaml
  on_http_request:
    - actions:
        - type: verify-webhook
          config:
            provider: clerk
            secret: "{endpoint signing secret}"
  ```

- Restart ngrok with the policy file:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file clerk_policy.yml
  ```

- Create a new user in Clerk to trigger the webhook.

Your app should receive the request and log it in the terminal.
