This guide explains how to use ngrok to receive Signal Sciences webhooks on your localhost app.

By integrating ngrok with Signal Sciences, you can:

- Develop and test Signal Sciences webhooks locally without deploying to a public environment or setting up HTTPS.
- Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Signal Sciences in real time via the inspection UI and API.
- Modify and replay Signal Sciences webhook requests with a single click instead of reproducing events manually in your Signal Sciences account.
- Secure your app with Signal Sciences webhook validation provided by ngrok.
  Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## What you'll need

- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup) and your [authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
- The [ngrok agent](https://ngrok.com/download) installed.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (for the sample app, or use your own app).
- A Signal Sciences account.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install the sample, run the following in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

Then start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs on port 3000 by default.

You can confirm it's running by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
The app logs request headers and body in the terminal and shows a message in the browser.

## 2. Expose your app with ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

- Copy [your ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) from the dashboard.

<Tip>
  The ngrok agent uses your authtoken to authenticate when you start a tunnel.
</Tip>

- Start ngrok:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000
  ```

- Copy the URL ngrok displays.
  Your app is now exposed at that URL for use with Signal Sciences.

## 3. Configure Signal Sciences to send webhooks

Signal Sciences can send webhook requests to your app when specific events occur in your account.
To register for those events:

- Sign in to the [Signal Sciences Dashboard](https://dashboard.signalsciences.net/).
- On the **Dashboard**, select your site from the **Sites** drop-down, click **Site Manage**, **Site Integrations**, and **Add site integration**.
- Click **Generic Webhook**.
- On the **Generic Webhook** page, enter your ngrok URL in **Webhook URL** (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).
- Select **All activity** and click **Create site integration**.

### Run webhooks with Signal Sciences and ngrok

Signal Sciences sends different request body contents depending on the event.
To trigger a call to your app:

- In the [Signal Sciences Dashboard](https://dashboard.signalsciences.net/), sign in and change your site display name.

Confirm your localhost app receives an event notification and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

## Secure webhook requests

ngrok can verify that incoming requests are from your Signal Sciences webhook so only that traffic reaches your app.

<Note>
  Webhook verification is limited to 500 validations per month on free accounts.
  If you need more, you can upgrade to Hobbyist or Pay-as-you-go.
  See [TPU Pricing](/pricing-limits/traffic-policy-unit-pricing/) for details.
</Note>

To add verification:

- In the [Signal Sciences Dashboard](https://dashboard.signalsciences.net/), go to **Site Integrations** in the **Manage** menu and click your webhook.
- On the **Webhook** page, click the eye icon to reveal the **secret key** and copy the value.
- Create a Traffic Policy file named `signalsciences_policy.yml`.
  Replace `{your webhook secret}` with the value you copied:

  ```yaml
  on_http_request:
    - actions:
        - type: verify-webhook
          config:
            provider: signalsciences
            secret: "{your webhook secret}"
  ```

- Restart ngrok with the policy file:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file signalsciences_policy.yml
  ```

- In the Signal Sciences dashboard, change your site display name to trigger an event.

Your app should receive the request and log it in the terminal.
