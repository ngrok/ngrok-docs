This guide shows you how to use ngrok to receive Contentful webhooks on your localhost app.

By integrating ngrok with Contentful, you can:

- Develop and test Contentful webhooks locally without deploying to a public environment or setting up HTTPS.
- Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Contentful in real time via the inspection UI and API.
- Modify and replay Contentful webhook requests with a single click instead of reproducing events manually in your Contentful account.
- Secure your app with Contentful webhook validation provided by ngrok.
  Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## What you'll need

- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup) and your [authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
- The [ngrok agent](https://ngrok.com/download) installed.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (for the sample app, or use your own app).
- A Contentful account.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install the sample, run the following in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

Then start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs on port 3000 by default.

You can confirm it's running by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
The app logs request headers and body in the terminal and shows a message in the browser.

## 2. Expose your app with ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

- Copy [your ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) from the dashboard.

<Tip>
  The ngrok agent uses your authtoken to authenticate when you start a tunnel.
</Tip>

- Start ngrok:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000
  ```

- Copy the URL ngrok displays.
  Your app is now exposed at that URL for use with Contentful.

## 3. Configure Contentful to send webhooks

Contentful can send webhook requests to your app when events occur in your account.
To register for those events:

- Sign in to the [Contentful site](https://contentful.com/).
- On the home page, click **Settings** in the top menu, click **Webhooks**, and then click **Add Webhook**.
- On the **Webhook** page, enter a name in **Name**, enter your ngrok URL in the **URL** field (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).
- Ensure the **Active** switch is on and **Trigger for all events** is selected under **Triggers**.
- Select **application/json** for **Content type** and click **Save**.

### Run webhooks with Contentful and ngrok

Contentful sends different request body contents depending on the event.
To trigger new calls from Contentful to your app:

- On the [Contentful site](https://contentful.com/), click **Media** in the top menu, click **Add Asset**, and then click **Single asset**.
- On the **Asset** page, drag and drop an image into the **File** area and click **Publish**.

Confirm your localhost app receives two event notifications and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

You can verify the webhook in Contentful: go to **Settings**, **Webhooks**, click your webhook, and open the **Activity log** tab.

## Secure webhook requests

ngrok can verify that incoming requests are from your Contentful webhook so only that traffic reaches your app.

<Note>
  Webhook verification is limited to 500 validations per month on free accounts.
  If you need more, you can upgrade to Hobbyist or Pay-as-you-go.
  See [TPU Pricing](/pricing-limits/traffic-policy-unit-pricing/) for details.
</Note>

To add verification:

- When you created the webhook in Contentful, you set a signing secret; copy that value (or create a new webhook and note the signing secret).
- Create a Traffic Policy file named `contentful_policy.yml`.
  Replace `{your webhook signing secret}` with the value from Contentful:

  ```yaml
  on_http_request:
    - actions:
        - type: verify-webhook
          config:
            provider: contentful
            secret: "{your webhook signing secret}"
  ```

- Restart ngrok with the policy file:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file contentful_policy.yml
  ```

- Publish an asset or make another change that triggers your webhook.

Your app should receive the request and log it in the terminal.
