This guide shows you how to use ngrok to receive Heroku webhooks on your localhost app.

By integrating ngrok with Heroku, you can:

- Develop and test Heroku webhooks locally without deploying to a public environment or setting up HTTPS.
- Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Heroku in real time via the inspection UI and API.
- Modify and replay Heroku webhook requests with a single click instead of reproducing events manually in your Heroku account.
- Secure your app with Heroku webhook validation provided by ngrok.
  Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## What you'll need

- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup) and your [authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
- The [ngrok agent](https://ngrok.com/download) installed.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (for the sample app, or use your own app).
- A Heroku account.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install the sample, run the following in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

Then start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs on port 3000 by default.

You can confirm it's running by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
The app logs request headers and body in the terminal and shows a message in the browser.

## 2. Expose your app with ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

- Copy [your ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) from the dashboard.

<Tip>  The ngrok agent uses your authtoken to authenticate when you start a tunnel.
</Tip>

- Start ngrok:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000
  ```

- Copy the URL ngrok displays.
  Your app is now exposed at that URL for use with Heroku.

## 3. Configure Heroku to send webhooks

Heroku can send webhook requests to your app when events occur in your account.
To register for those events:

- Sign in to [Heroku](https://heroku.com/).
- On the Dashboard, click an app from the **Personal** app list.

<Note>  If you don't have an app, click **New** and then **Create new app**.
</Note>

- On the app page, click **More**, **View Webhooks**, and then **Create Webhook**.
- On the **New Webhook** popup, enter a name in **Webhook Name**, enter your ngrok URL in **Payload URL** (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).
- Enter a value in the **Secret** field (for example, `12345`), check **api:app** and **api:build** under **Event Types**, and click **Add Webhook**.

### Run webhooks with Heroku and ngrok

Heroku sends different request body contents depending on the event.
To trigger a call from Heroku to your app:

- On the Dashboard, click your app, open the **Deploy** tab, scroll to **Manual deploy**, select a branch, and click **Deploy Branch**.
- After the deployment finishes, confirm your localhost app receives the notification and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

You can verify the webhook in Heroku: click your app, **More**, **View Webhooks**, and then click your webhook in the list.

## Secure webhook requests

ngrok can verify that incoming requests are from your Heroku webhook so only that traffic reaches your app.

<Note>
  Webhook verification is limited to 500 validations per month on free accounts.
  If you need more, you can upgrade to Hobbyist or Pay-as-you-go.
  See [TPU Pricing](/pricing-limits/traffic-policy-unit-pricing/) for details.
</Note>

To add verification:

- Create a Traffic Policy file named `heroku_policy.yml`.
  Replace `{your webhook secret}` with the value you entered in the **Secret** field when you registered the webhook:

  ```yaml
  on_http_request:
    - actions:
        - type: verify-webhook
          config:
            provider: heroku
            secret: "{your webhook secret}"
  ```

- Restart ngrok with the policy file:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file heroku_policy.yml
  ```

- Run a new build for your app in Heroku to trigger the webhook.

Your app should receive the request and log it in the terminal.
