This guide explains how to use ngrok to receive Dropbox webhooks on your localhost app.

By integrating ngrok with Dropbox, you can:

- Develop and test Dropbox webhooks locally without deploying to a public environment or setting up HTTPS.
- Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Dropbox in real time via the inspection UI and API.
- Modify and replay Dropbox webhook requests with a single click instead of reproducing events manually in your Dropbox account.
- Secure your app with Dropbox webhook validation provided by ngrok.
  Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## What you'll need

- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup) and your [authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
- The [ngrok agent](https://ngrok.com/download) installed.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (for the sample app, or use your own app).
- A Dropbox account.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install the sample, run the following in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

Then start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs on port 3000 by default.

You can confirm it's running by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
The app logs request headers and body in the terminal and shows a message in the browser.

## 2. Expose your app with ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

- Copy [your ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) from the dashboard.

<Tip>  The ngrok agent uses your authtoken to authenticate when you start a tunnel.
</Tip>

- Start ngrok:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000
  ```

- Copy the URL ngrok displays.
  Your app is now exposed at that URL for use with Dropbox.

## 3. Configure Dropbox to send webhooks

Dropbox can send webhook requests to your app when events occur in your account.
To register for those events:

- Sign in to the [Dropbox site](https://dropbox.com/) and open the [Dropbox developer site](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps).
- On the **My apps** page, click **Create app**.
- On the **Create a new app** page, click **Scoped access**, click **App folder** under **Choose the type of access you need**, enter a name in **App name**, check the terms and conditions, and click **Create app**.
- On your app page, enter your ngrok URL in the **Webhook URIs** field (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`) and click **Add** in the **Webhooks** section.
- Confirm your localhost app receives a one-time call from Dropbox and logs the challenge parameter in the terminal.
- Confirm your webhook appears in the **Webhooks** section with **Enabled** status.

### Run webhooks with Dropbox and ngrok

With **App folder** access, Dropbox creates a folder with your app's name under **Apps**.
To trigger new calls from Dropbox to your app:

- In [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com/), go to **Apps** under **All files** in the left menu.
- Click your app's folder and upload a file by dragging it from your desktop into the folder.

Dropbox sends a POST request to your app when the upload completes.

<Note>
  The payload does not include file or folder changes; it only indicates which users have changes.
  Your app must call the Dropbox API to get the latest changes for each user.
</Note>

<Tip>  You can create an app with **Scoped access** and **Full Dropbox** to receive notifications for any folder.

## Secure webhook requests

ngrok can verify that incoming requests are from your Dropbox webhook so only that traffic reaches your app.

<Note>
  Webhook verification is limited to 500 validations per month on free accounts.
  If you need more, you can upgrade to Hobbyist or Pay-as-you-go.
  See [TPU Pricing](/pricing-limits/traffic-policy-unit-pricing/) for details.
</Note>

To add verification:

- On the [Dropbox developer site](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps), click your app, open the **Settings** tab, click **Show** for **App secret**, and copy the value.
- Create a Traffic Policy file named `dropbox_policy.yml`.
  Replace `{your app secret}` with the value you copied:

  ```yaml
  on_http_request:
    - actions:
        - type: verify-webhook
          config:
            provider: dropbox
            secret: "{your app secret}"
  ```

- Restart ngrok with the policy file:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file dropbox_policy.yml
  ```

- Upload a new file to your app folder in Dropbox to trigger the webhook.

Your app should receive the request and log it in the terminal.
