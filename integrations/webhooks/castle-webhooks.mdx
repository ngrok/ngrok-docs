<Tip>
**TL;DR**



To integrate Castle webhooks with ngrok:

1. [Launch your local webhook.](#start-your-app) `npm start`
1. [Launch ngrok.](#start-ngrok) `ngrok http 3000`
1. [Configure Castle webhooks with your ngrok URL.](#setup-webhook)
1. [Secure your webhook requests with verification.](#security)
</Tip>

This guide covers how to use ngrok to integrate your localhost app with Castle by using Webhooks.
Castle webhooks can be used to notify an external application whenever specific events occur in your Castle account.

By integrating ngrok with Castle, you can:

- **Develop and test Castle webhooks locally**, eliminating the time in deploying your development code to a public environment and setting it up in HTTPS.
- **Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Castle** in real-time via the inspection UI and API.
- **Modify and Replay Castle Webhook requests** with a single click and without spending time reproducing events manually in your Castle account.
- **Secure your app with Castle validation provided by ngrok**. Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## 1. Start your app 

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app available on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install this sample, run the following commands in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

This will get the project installed locally.

Now you can launch the app by running the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs by default on port 3000.

You can validate that the app is up and running by visiting http://localhost:3000. The application logs request headers and body in the terminal and responds with a message in the browser.

## 2. Launch ngrok 

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

1. If you're not an ngrok user yet, just [sign up for ngrok for free](https://ngrok.com/signup).

1. [Download the ngrok agent](https://download.ngrok.com).

1. Go to the [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com) and copy your Authtoken. <br />
   **Tip:** The ngrok agent uses the auth token to log into your account when you start a tunnel.
1. Start ngrok by running the following command:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

1. ngrok will display a URL where your localhost application is exposed to the internet (copy this URL for use with Castle).

## 3. Integrate Castle 

To register a webhook on your Castle account follow the instructions below:

1. Access the [Castle dashboard](https://dashboard.castle.io/) and sign in using your Castle account.

1. On the left menu, click the gear icon close to your name and then click **Configuration**.

1. On the **Application** page, click **Webhooks** on the top menu, and then click **Add a new Endpoint**.

1. On the **Set up a new webhook endpoint** page, enter the URL provided by the ngrok agent to expose your application to the internet in the **ENDPOINT URL** field (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).

1. Select all events under the **EVENTS TO SUBSCRIBE** section and then click **Save**.

1. On the **Webhooks** page, click the slider icon to activate the webhook.

### Run webhooks with Castle and ngrok

Castle sends different request body contents depending on the event that is being triggered.
You can trigger new calls from Castle to your application by following the instructions below.

1. On the **Application** page, click **Webhooks** on the top menu and then click **Test** for your webhook.

1. On the **Test the webhook endpoint** popup, select an event in the **EVENT** field and then click **Send test webhook**.
   **Note**: Optionally, you can create an event by using the Castle SDK.

   Confirm your localhost app receives the test event notification and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

## Secure webhook requests 

The ngrok signature webhook verification feature allows ngrok to assert that requests from your Castle webhook are the only traffic allowed to make calls to your localhost app.

**Note:** This ngrok feature is limited to 500 validations per month on free ngrok accounts. For unlimited, upgrade to Pro or Enterprise.

This is a quick step to add extra protection to your application.

1. Access the [Castle dashboard](https://dashboard.castle.io/) and sign in using your Castle account.

1. On the left menu, click the gear icon close to your name and then click **Configuration**.

1. On the **Application** page, copy the value of the **API SECRET** field.

1. Create a traffic policy file named `castle_policy.yml`, replacing `{your api secret}` with the value you have copied before:

   ```yaml
   on_http_request:
     - actions:
         - type: verify-webhook
           config:
             provider: castle
             secret: "{your api secret}"
   ```

1. Restart your ngrok agent by running the command:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file castle_policy.yml
   ```

1. Access the [Castle dashboard](https://dashboard.castle.io/) and test the webhook endpoint or create an event by using the Castle SDK.

Verify that your local application receives the request and logs information to the terminal.
