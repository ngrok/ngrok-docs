This guide shows you how to use ngrok to receive Zoom webhooks on your localhost app.

By integrating ngrok with Zoom, you can:

- Develop and test Zoom webhooks locally without deploying to a public environment or setting up HTTPS.
- Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Zoom in real time via the inspection UI and API.
- Modify and replay Zoom webhook requests with a single click instead of reproducing events manually in your Zoom account.
- Secure your app with Zoom webhook validation provided by ngrok.
  Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## What you'll need

- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup) and your [authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
- The [ngrok agent](https://ngrok.com/download) installed.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (for the sample app, or use your own app).
- A Zoom account.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install the sample, run the following in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

Then start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs on port 3000 by default.

You can confirm it's running by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
The app logs request headers and body in the terminal and shows a message in the browser.

## 2. Expose your app with ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

- Copy [your ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) from the dashboard.

<Tip>
  The ngrok agent uses your authtoken to authenticate when you start a tunnel.
</Tip>

- Start ngrok:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000
  ```

- Copy the URL ngrok displays.
  Your app is now exposed at that URL for use with Zoom.

## 3. Configure Zoom to send webhooks

Zoom can send webhook requests to your app when meeting and other events occur.
This guide uses the **Webhook Only** app type (free Zoom account).

- Sign in to the [Zoom Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/).
- Click **Develop** > **Build App**, select **Webhook Only**, enter a **Name**, and click **Create**.
- Complete registration with **Company Name**, developer **Name**, and **Email**, then click **Continue**.
- On **Feature**, turn **Event subscriptions** on and click **Add Event Subscriptions**.
- Enter your ngrok URL in **Event notification endpoint URL** (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).
- Copy the **Secret Token** for use in verification.
- Click **Add Events**, select events (e.g. **Start Meeting**, **End Meeting**), click **Done**, then **Save** and **Continue**.
- When you see **Your app is activated on the account**, Zoom is ready to send events. You can review the webhook under **Manage** on the Marketplace page.

### Run webhooks with Zoom and ngrok

After the webhook is added, start a meeting in your Zoom account and end it after a few seconds.
Your localhost app receives notifications for both events.

<Tip>
  Zoom sends different request body contents and headers depending on the event.
  Each request includes an **authorization** header with the **Secret Token**; you can validate this in your app or use ngrok’s webhook verification below.
</Tip>

You can review **Manage** > **Call Logs** > **Webhook Logs** in the Marketplace to compare request bodies with what your app received.

<InspectingRequests />

<ReplayingRequests />

## Secure webhook requests

ngrok can verify that incoming requests are from your Zoom webhook so only that traffic reaches your app.

<Note>
  Webhook verification is limited to 500 validations per month on free accounts.
  If you need more, you can upgrade to Hobbyist or Pay-as-you-go.
  See [TPU Pricing](/pricing-limits/traffic-policy-unit-pricing/) for details.
</Note>

To add verification:

- Use the **Secret Token** you copied when configuring the webhook (see [Configure Zoom to send webhooks](#3-configure-zoom-to-send-webhooks)).
- Create a Traffic Policy file named `zoom_policy.yml`.
  Replace `{your secret token}` with that value:

  ```yaml
  on_http_request:
    - actions:
        - type: verify-webhook
          config:
            provider: zoom
            secret: "{your secret token}"
  ```

- Restart ngrok with the policy file:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file zoom_policy.yml
  ```

- Start and then end a meeting in Zoom to trigger the webhook.

Your app should receive the request and log it in the terminal.
