This guide shows you how to use ngrok to receive Terraform Cloud webhooks on your localhost app.

By integrating ngrok with Terraform Cloud, you can:

- Develop and test Terraform Cloud webhooks locally without deploying to a public environment or setting up HTTPS.
- Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Terraform Cloud in real time via the inspection UI and API.
- Modify and replay Terraform Cloud webhook requests with a single click instead of reproducing events manually in your Terraform Cloud account.
- Secure your app with Terraform Cloud webhook validation provided by ngrok.
  Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## What you'll need

- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup) and your [authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
- The [ngrok agent](https://ngrok.com/download) installed.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (for the sample app, or use your own app).
- A Terraform Cloud account.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install the sample, run the following in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

Then start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs on port 3000 by default.

You can confirm it's running by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
The app logs request headers and body in the terminal and shows a message in the browser.

## 2. Expose your app with ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

- Copy [your ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) from the dashboard.

<Tip>
  The ngrok agent uses your authtoken to authenticate when you start a tunnel.
</Tip>

- Start ngrok:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000
  ```

- Copy the URL ngrok displays.
  Your app is now exposed at that URL for use with Terraform Cloud.

## 3. Configure Terraform Cloud to send webhooks

Terraform Cloud can send webhook requests to your app when workspace events occur.
To register for those events:

- Sign in to [Terraform Cloud](https://app.terraform.io/) and open your workspace.
- Click **Settings** and **Notifications** in the left menu.
- On **Notifications**, click **Create Notification**.
- On **Create a Notification**, click the **Webhook** tile, enter a **Name** (for example, `ngrok`), and enter your ngrok URL in **Webhook URL** (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).
- Under **Triggers**, click **All events**.

Confirm your localhost app receives the verification request and logs both headers and body in the terminal.
You can also click **Send a test** on the notification details page to trigger a test notification.

### Run webhooks with Terraform Cloud and ngrok

Terraform Cloud sends different request body contents depending on the event.
To trigger a run:

- At the top of the workspace, click **Actions** and **Start new run**.
- Enter a reason (for example, `My New Run`), select **Plan and apply** for **Choose run type**, and click **Start run**.

Confirm your localhost app receives event notifications and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

## Secure webhook requests

ngrok can verify that incoming requests are from your Terraform Cloud webhook so only that traffic reaches your app.

<Note>
  Webhook verification is limited to 500 validations per month on free accounts.
  If you need more, you can upgrade to Hobbyist or Pay-as-you-go.
  See [TPU Pricing](/pricing-limits/traffic-policy-unit-pricing/) for details.
</Note>

To add verification:

- In [Terraform Cloud](https://app.terraform.io/), open your workspace, then **Settings**, **Notifications**, and the notification you created (for example, **ngrok**).
- Click **Edit Notification**, enter a value in the **Token** field (for example, `12345`), and click **Update notification**.
- Create a Traffic Policy file named `terraform_policy.yml`.
  Replace `{your webhook token}` with that token value:

  ```yaml
  on_http_request:
    - actions:
        - type: verify-webhook
          config:
            provider: terraform
            secret: "{your webhook token}"
  ```

- Restart ngrok with the policy file:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file terraform_policy.yml
  ```

- Start a new run (e.g. **Actions** > **Start new run** with **Plan and apply**) to trigger the webhook.

Your app should receive the request and log it in the terminal.
