This guide explains how to use ngrok to receive Modern Treasury webhooks on your localhost app.

By integrating ngrok with Modern Treasury, you can:

- Develop and test Modern Treasury webhooks locally without deploying to a public environment or setting up HTTPS.
- Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Modern Treasury in real time via the inspection UI and API.
- Modify and replay Modern Treasury webhook requests with a single click instead of reproducing events manually in your Modern Treasury account.
- Secure your app with Modern Treasury webhook validation provided by ngrok.
  Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## What you'll need

- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup) and your [authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
- The [ngrok agent](https://ngrok.com/download) installed.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (for the sample app, or use your own app).
- A Modern Treasury account.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install the sample, run the following in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

Then start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs on port 3000 by default.

You can confirm it's running by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
The app logs request headers and body in the terminal and shows a message in the browser.

## 2. Expose your app with ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

- Copy [your ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) from the dashboard.

<Tip>
  The ngrok agent uses your authtoken to authenticate when you start a tunnel.
</Tip>

- Start ngrok:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000
  ```

- Copy the URL ngrok displays.
  Your app is now exposed at that URL for use with Modern Treasury.

## 3. Configure Modern Treasury to send webhooks

Modern Treasury can send webhook requests to your app when events occur in your account.
To register for those events:

- Sign in to the [Modern Treasury site](https://app.moderntreasury.com/).
- Click **View Sandbox** to switch to Sandbox mode if you want to use example accounts.

<Note>
  If you have an active Modern Treasury account, you can skip switching to Sandbox.
</Note>

- Click **Developers**, the **Webhooks** tab, and then **Create New Webhook Endpoint**.
- On **New webhook**, enter your ngrok URL in **Webhook URL** (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).
- Ensure **Receive all events** is selected for **Events to send** and click **Save**.

### Run webhooks with Modern Treasury and ngrok

Modern Treasury sends different request body contents depending on the event.
To trigger new calls from Modern Treasury to your app:

- On the [Modern Treasury site](https://app.moderntreasury.com/), switch to Sandbox if needed.
- Click **Payments** and **Payments Overview**.
- Click **Create New** and **Payment Order**.
- On **Create Payment Order**, click **Pay**, select a revenue account in **From**, a counterparty in **To**, **ACH** as **Payment Method**, enter an amount (for example, **$10.00**), and click **Create Payment Order**.

Confirm your localhost app receives event notifications as the payment updates and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

You can verify events in Modern Treasury under **Developers**, **Events** tab.

<ReplayingRequests />

## Secure webhook requests

ngrok can verify that incoming requests are from your Modern Treasury webhook so only that traffic reaches your app.

<Note>
  Webhook verification is limited to 500 validations per month on free accounts.
  If you need more, you can upgrade to Hobbyist or Pay-as-you-go.
  See [TPU Pricing](/pricing-limits/traffic-policy-unit-pricing/) for details.
</Note>

To add verification:

- In [Modern Treasury](https://app.moderntreasury.com/), go to **Developers**, **Webhooks** tab, and click your webhook URL.
- On the webhook page, copy the **Webhook Key** value.
- Create a Traffic Policy file named `modern_treasury_policy.yml`.
  Replace `{your webhook key}` with the value you copied:

  ```yaml
  on_http_request:
    - actions:
        - type: verify-webhook
          config:
            provider: modern_treasury
            secret: "{your webhook key}"
  ```

- Restart ngrok with the policy file:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file modern_treasury_policy.yml
  ```

- Create a new payment order in Modern Treasury to trigger the webhook.

Your app should receive the request and log it in the terminal.
