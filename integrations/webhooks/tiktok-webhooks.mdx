This guide walks you through using ngrok to receive TikTok webhooks on your localhost app.

By integrating ngrok with TikTok, you can:

- Develop and test TikTok webhooks locally without deploying to a public environment or setting up HTTPS.
- Inspect and troubleshoot requests from TikTok in real time via the inspection UI and API.
- Modify and replay TikTok webhook requests with a single click instead of reproducing events manually in your TikTok app.
- Secure your app with TikTok webhook validation provided by ngrok.
  Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## What you'll need

- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup) and your [authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
- The [ngrok agent](https://ngrok.com/download) installed.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (for the sample app, or use your own app).
- A TikTok Developer account.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install the sample, run the following in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

Then start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs on port 3000 by default.

You can confirm it's running by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
The app logs request headers and body in the terminal and shows a message in the browser.

## 2. Expose your app with ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

- Copy [your ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) from the dashboard.

<Tip>  The ngrok agent uses your authtoken to authenticate when you start a tunnel.
</Tip>

- Start ngrok:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000
  ```

- Copy the URL ngrok displays.
  Your app is now exposed at that URL for use with TikTok.

## 3. Configure TikTok to send webhooks

TikTok can send webhook requests to your app when events occur in your TikTok app.
To register for those events:

- Sign in to the [TikTok Developer Portal](https://developers.tiktok.com/).
- Click **Manage apps** and **Connect an app** (or open an existing app).
- Upload an **App icon**, set **Category** to **Others**, add a **Description**, enable **Configure for Web**, enter a **Website URL**, and click **Save changes**.
- On the app page, click **Add products** and **Add** for **Webhooks** (you may need to add **Login Kit** first).
- Under **Webhooks**, enter your ngrok URL in **Callback URL** (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).
- Click **Test URL** and **Send**, confirm your app receives the notification and returns 200, then click **Done** and **Save changes**.

<Note>
  You may need to set **Terms of Service URL**, **Privacy Policy URL**, and **Redirect domain** in **Login Kit**.
  If the app is not published, click **Submit for review**.
</Note>

### Run webhooks with TikTok and ngrok

By default you are subscribed to all events.
TikTok sends different request body contents depending on the event.

After your app is approved, associate a user with your app.
TikTok will send notifications to your localhost app for events such as account deauthorization, video upload failure, or video published.
Confirm your localhost app receives these event notifications and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

## Secure webhook requests

ngrok can verify that incoming requests are from your TikTok webhook so only that traffic reaches your app.

<Note>
  Webhook verification is limited to 500 validations per month on free accounts.
  If you need more, you can upgrade to Hobbyist or Pay-as-you-go.
  See [TPU Pricing](/pricing-limits/traffic-policy-unit-pricing/) for details.
</Note>

To add verification:

- In the [TikTok Developer Portal](https://developers.tiktok.com/), open **Manage apps**, click your app, click the eye icon to reveal **Client secret**, and copy the value.
- Create a Traffic Policy file named `tiktok_policy.yml`.
  Replace `{your webhook secret}` with the value you copied:

  ```yaml
  on_http_request:
    - actions:
        - type: verify-webhook
          config:
            provider: tiktok
            secret: "{your webhook secret}"
  ```

- Restart ngrok with the policy file:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file tiktok_policy.yml
  ```

- Use your TikTok app (or trigger an event as in [Run webhooks with TikTok and ngrok](#run-webhooks-with-tiktok-and-ngrok)) to send a request.

Your app should receive the request and log it in the terminal.
