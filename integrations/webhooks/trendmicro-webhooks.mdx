This guide explains how to use ngrok to receive Trend Micro Cloud One Conformity webhooks on your localhost app.

By integrating ngrok with Trend Micro, you can:

- Develop and test Trend Micro webhooks locally without deploying to a public environment or setting up HTTPS.
- Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Trend Micro in real time via the inspection UI and API.
- Modify and replay Trend Micro webhook requests with a single click instead of reproducing events manually in your Trend Micro account.
- Secure your app with Trend Micro webhook validation provided by ngrok.
  Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## What you'll need

- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup) and your [authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
- The [ngrok agent](https://ngrok.com/download) installed.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (for the sample app, or use your own app).
- A Trend Micro Cloud One account.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install the sample, run the following in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

Then start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs on port 3000 by default.

You can confirm it's running by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
The app logs request headers and body in the terminal and shows a message in the browser.

## 2. Expose your app with ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

- Copy [your ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) from the dashboard.

<Tip>  The ngrok agent uses your authtoken to authenticate when you start a tunnel.
</Tip>

- Start ngrok:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000
  ```

- Copy the URL ngrok displays.
  Your app is now exposed at that URL for use with Trend Micro.

## 3. Configure Trend Micro to send webhooks

Trend Micro Cloud One Conformity can send webhook requests to your app when the Conformity bot runs.
To set it up:

- Sign in to [Trend Micro Cloud One](https://cloudone.trendmicro.com/).
- Click the **Conformity** tile.
- On **Accounts**, click **Settings**, **Update communication settings**, and **Configure** under **Webhooks**.

<Note>  If no cloud provider is associated with Conformity, add one first.
</Note>

- On **Webhooks**, click **Create a Webhook channel**, **Configure webhook**, and enter your ngrok URL in **Webhook URL** (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).
- Click **Save** and turn **Automatic notifications** on.

### Run webhooks with Trend Micro and ngrok

Conformity notifies your webhook after the bot runs and revises your cloud account for compliance.
To trigger a run:

- On [Trend Micro Cloud One](https://cloudone.trendmicro.com/home), click the **Conformity** tile.
- On **Accounts**, click **Run Conformity Bot**.

After the bot finishes, confirm your localhost app receives a notification and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

## Secure webhook requests

ngrok can verify that incoming requests are from your Trend Micro webhook so only that traffic reaches your app.

<Note>
  Webhook verification is limited to 500 validations per month on free accounts.
  If you need more, you can upgrade to Hobbyist or Pay-as-you-go.
  See [TPU Pricing](/pricing-limits/traffic-policy-unit-pricing/) for details.
</Note>

To add verification:

- In [Trend Micro Cloud One](https://cloudone.trendmicro.com/), go to **Conformity** > **Accounts** > **Settings** > **Update communication settings** > **Configure** (Webhooks) > **Configure now**.
- In the **Send notification to** popup, enter a value in **Webhook Security Token** (for example, `12345`) and click **Save**.
- Create a Traffic Policy file named `trendmicro_policy.yml`.
  Replace `{your webhook token}` with that value:

  ```yaml
  on_http_request:
    - actions:
        - type: verify-webhook
          config:
            provider: trendmicro_conformity
            secret: "{your webhook token}"
  ```

- Restart ngrok with the policy file:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file trendmicro_policy.yml
  ```

- Run the Conformity bot again to trigger the webhook.

Your app should receive the request and log it in the terminal.
