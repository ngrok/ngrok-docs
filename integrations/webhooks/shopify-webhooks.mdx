This guide walks you through using ngrok to receive Shopify webhooks on your localhost app.

By integrating ngrok with Shopify, you can:

- Develop and test Shopify webhooks locally without deploying to a public environment or setting up HTTPS.
- Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Shopify in real time via the inspection UI and API.
- Modify and replay Shopify webhook requests with a single click instead of reproducing events manually in your Shopify store.
- Secure your app with Shopify webhook validation provided by ngrok.
  Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## What you'll need

- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup) and your [authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
- The [ngrok agent](https://ngrok.com/download) installed.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (for the sample app, or use your own app).
- A Shopify store.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install the sample, run the following in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

Then start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs on port 3000 by default.

You can confirm it's running by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
The app logs request headers and body in the terminal and shows a message in the browser.

## 2. Expose your app with ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

- Copy [your ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) from the dashboard.

<Tip>
  The ngrok agent uses your authtoken to authenticate when you start a tunnel.
</Tip>

- Start ngrok:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000
  ```

- Copy the URL ngrok displays.
  Your app is now exposed at that URL for use with Shopify.

## 3. Configure Shopify to send webhooks

Shopify can send webhook requests to your app when events occur in your store.
To register for those events:

- Sign in to your Shopify account, select your store, and click **Settings** at the bottom of the left menu.
- Click **Notifications**, scroll to **Webhooks**, and click **Create webhook**.
- In **Add webhook**, select **Product creation** for **Event** and **JSON** for **Format**.
- Enter your ngrok URL in **URL** (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).
- For **Webhook API version**, select an option that includes `(Latest)` and click **Save**.

Optionally, copy the signing key shown in the **Webhooks** section for use in verification.

### Run webhooks with Shopify and ngrok

You can send a test from the **Webhooks** section with **Send test notification**.
With **Product creation** selected, creating a product triggers a notification:

- Click **Products** and **Add product**.
- Enter a **Title**, **Price**, and **SKU** and click **Save**.

Confirm your localhost app receives the notification and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

<Tip>
  Shopify sends different request body contents depending on the event you selected.

## Secure webhook requests

ngrok can verify that incoming requests are from your Shopify webhook so only that traffic reaches your app.

<Note>
  Webhook verification is limited to 500 validations per month on free accounts.
  If you need more, you can upgrade to Hobbyist or Pay-as-you-go.
  See [TPU Pricing](/pricing-limits/traffic-policy-unit-pricing/) for details.
</Note>

To add verification:

- In **Settings**, **Notifications**, **Webhooks**, copy the value shown after **All your webhooks will be signed with**.
- Create a Traffic Policy file named `shopify_policy.yml`.
  Replace `{your signing secret}` with the value you copied:

  ```yaml
  on_http_request:
    - actions:
        - type: verify-webhook
          config:
            provider: shopify
            secret: "{your signing secret}"
  ```

- Restart ngrok with the policy file:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file shopify_policy.yml
  ```

- Create a product in your Shopify store to trigger the webhook.

Your app should receive the request and log it in the terminal.
