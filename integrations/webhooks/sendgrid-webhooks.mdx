This guide explains how to use ngrok to receive SendGrid webhooks on your localhost app.

By integrating ngrok with SendGrid, you can:

- Develop and test SendGrid webhooks locally without deploying to a public environment or setting up HTTPS.
- Inspect and troubleshoot requests from SendGrid in real time via the inspection UI and API.
- Modify and replay SendGrid webhook requests with a single click instead of reproducing events manually in your SendGrid account.
- Secure your app with SendGrid webhook validation provided by ngrok.
  Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## What you'll need

- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup) and your [authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
- The [ngrok agent](https://ngrok.com/download) installed.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (for the sample app, or use your own app).
- A SendGrid account.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install the sample, run the following in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

Then start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs on port 3000 by default.

You can confirm it's running by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
The app logs request headers and body in the terminal and shows a message in the browser.

## 2. Expose your app with ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

- Copy [your ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) from the dashboard.

<Tip>
  The ngrok agent uses your authtoken to authenticate when you start a tunnel.
</Tip>

- Start ngrok:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000
  ```

- Copy the URL ngrok displays.
  Your app is now exposed at that URL for use with SendGrid.

## 3. Configure SendGrid to send webhooks

SendGrid can send webhook requests to your app with information about events as it processes your email.
To register for those events:

- Sign in to the [SendGrid Dashboard](https://app.sendgrid.com/).
- Click **Settings** and **Mail Settings**.
- On **Mail Settings**, click **Event Webhook**.
- In the **Event Webhook** popup, set **Authorization Method** to `None` and enter your ngrok URL in **HTTP Post URL** (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).
- Click **Test Your Integration** and confirm your localhost app receives the test.
- Under **DELIVERABILITY DATA**, select **Select All**.
- Under **Event Webhook Status**, set to **ENABLED** and click **Save**.

### Run webhooks with SendGrid and ngrok

To trigger webhooks, send an email through SendGrid (Web API or SMTP); SendGrid notifies your app on delivery success or failure.

- In SendGrid, go to **Email API** and **Integration Guide**.
- Choose **Web API** and **cURL**, enter a key name (for example, `myappkey`), and click **Create Key**.
- Run the curl command from the guide (use your sender identity and a real recipient email).

Confirm your localhost app receives notifications about the email being processed and delivered.

<Tip>
  SendGrid sends different request body contents depending on the events you selected.
</Tip>

You can confirm delivery under **Activity** and **Search** in the SendGrid UI.

## Secure webhook requests

ngrok can verify that incoming requests are from your SendGrid webhook so only that traffic reaches your app.

<Note>
  Webhook verification is limited to 500 validations per month on free accounts.
  If you need more, you can upgrade to Hobbyist or Pay-as-you-go.
  See [TPU Pricing](/pricing-limits/traffic-policy-unit-pricing/) for details.
</Note>

To add verification:

- In the [SendGrid Dashboard](https://app.sendgrid.com/), go to **Settings** and **Mail Settings**.
- Click **Signed Event Webhook Requests**.
- In the popup, click **Generate Verification Key**, copy the key value, and click **Close**.

<Note>
  Ensure **Signed Event Webhook Request Status** is **ENABLED**.
</Note>

- Create a Traffic Policy file named `sendgrid_policy.yml`.
  Replace `{your verification key}` with the value you copied:

  ```yaml
  on_http_request:
    - actions:
        - type: verify-webhook
          config:
            provider: sendgrid
            secret: "{your verification key}"
  ```

- Restart ngrok with the policy file:

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file sendgrid_policy.yml
  ```

- Send an email through SendGrid to trigger the webhook.

Your app should receive the request and log it in the terminal.
