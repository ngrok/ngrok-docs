This guide covers how to use ngrok to integrate your localhost app with SendGrid by using Webhooks.
SendGrid webhooks can be used to notify an external application with information about events that occur as SendGrid processes your email.

By integrating ngrok with SendGrid, you can:

- **Develop and test SendGrid webhooks locally**, eliminating the time in deploying your development code to a public environment and setting it up in HTTPS.
- **Inspect and troubleshoot requests from SendGrid** in real-time via the inspection UI and API.
- **Modify and Replay SendGrid Webhook requests** with a single click and without spending time reproducing events manually in your SendGrid account.
- **Secure your app with SendGrid validation provided by ngrok**. Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## 1. Start your app

For this tutorial, you can use the [sample Node.js app available on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install this sample, run the following commands in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

This will get the project installed locally.

Now you can launch the app by running the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs by default on port 3000.

You can validate that the app is up and running by visiting http://localhost:3000. The application logs request headers and body in the terminal and responds with a message in the browser.

## 2. Launch ngrok

Once your app is running locally, you're ready to put it online securely using ngrok.

1. If you're not an ngrok user yet, just [sign up for ngrok for free](https://ngrok.com/signup).

1. [Download the ngrok agent](https://download.ngrok.com).

1. Go to the [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com) and copy your Authtoken. <br />
   **Tip:** The ngrok agent uses the auth token to log into your account when you start a tunnel.
1. Start ngrok by running the following command:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

1. ngrok will display a URL where your localhost application is exposed to the internet (copy this URL for use with SendGrid).

## 3. Integrate SendGrid

To register an event webhook to your SendGrid account follow the instructions below:

1. Access the [SendGrid Dashboard](https://app.sendgrid.com/), and then sign in using your SendGrid credentials.

1. On the left menu, click **Settings** and then click **Mail Settings**.

1. In the **Mail Settings** page, click **Event Webhook**.

1. In the **Event Webhook** popup, select `None` as the **Authorization Method** and in the **HTTP Post URL** field enter the URL provided by the ngrok agent to expose your application to the internet (for example, `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).

1. Click **Test Your Integration** and confirm your localhost app receives information about this test.

1. Under **DELIVERABILITY DATA**, select the **Select All** option.

1. Under **Event Webhook Status**, click **ENABLED** and then click **Save**.

### Run webhooks with SendGrid and ngrok

To activate the webhook you need to send an email through SendGrid. SendGrid processes your email and upon successful or failed delivery notifies your localhost application accordingly.

To send an email you can either use SendGrid Web API or SMTP.

1. In the SendGrid UI, click **Email API** on the left menu, and then click **Integration Guide**.

1. In the **Integrate using our Web API or SMTP Relay** page, click **Choose** in the **Web API** tile, and then click **Choose** in the **cURL** tile.

1. In the **My First API Key Name** field, type `myappkey`, and then click **Create Key**.

1. Open a terminal on your desktop, run the command to export the SendGrid API Key, and then run the curl command.
   **Note**: Replace the `email from` field with the email you have registered in SendGrid as sender identity. **Note**: Replace the `email to` field with a real email in which you can confirm the email receipt.

Confirm your localhost app receives notifications about the email being both processed and delivered.

**Tip:** SendGrid sends different request body contents depending on the event you select during the webhook registration.

1. Optionally, in the SendGrid UI, click **Activity**, and then click **Search**.

Confirm the delivery of the email you have sent using the SendGrid Web API.

## Secure webhook requests

The ngrok signature webhook verification feature allows ngrok to assert that requests from your SendGrid webhook are the only traffic allowed to make calls to your localhost app.

**Note:** This ngrok feature is limited to 500 validations per month on free ngrok accounts. For unlimited, upgrade to Pro or Enterprise.

This is a quick step to add extra protection to your application.

1. Access the [SendGrid Dashboard](https://app.sendgrid.com/), and then sign in using your SendGrid credentials.

1. On the left menu, click **Settings** and then click **Mail Settings**.

1. In the **Mail Settings** page, click **Signed Event Webhook Requests**.

1. In the **Signed Event Webhook Requests** popup window, click **Generate Verification Key**, copy the value of the key that appears in the page, and then click **Close**.
   **Tip**: Make sure the **Signed Event Webhook Request Status** is **ENABLED**.

1. Create a Traffic Policy file named `sendgrid_policy.yml`, replacing `{your verification key}` with the value you copied before:

   ```yaml
   on_http_request:
     - actions:
         - type: verify-webhook
           config:
             provider: sendgrid
             secret: "{your verification key}"
   ```

1. Restart your ngrok agent by running the command:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file sendgrid_policy.yml
   ```

1. Reproduce the steps to send an email through your SendGrid account.

Verify that your local application receives the request and logs information to the terminal.
