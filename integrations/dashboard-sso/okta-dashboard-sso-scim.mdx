This guide covers enabling automated user provisioning for your ngrok account via SCIM with Okta.

<Note>
This document assumes you have already set up [Okta for dashboard SSO](/integrations/dashboard-sso/okta-dashboard-sso-oidc).
Once you've completed those steps, you can continue here.
</Note>

## Configuring ngrok

Start by logging into your ngrok Dashboard as an admin user.

1. Navigate to **Settings > Account**.
2. Go to the **User Provisioning / SCIM** section and toggle on the **Automated User Provisioning via SCIM 2.0** option.
This opens a drawer and prompts you to create a new API key.
It is recommended to use a unique key just for SCIM.
3. Give the API key a descriptive name and assign it either to an administrator user or a Service User.
Service Users are ideal for this integration because they are not deactivated when a user leaves the account.
4. Save the API key somewhere safe or keep this window up while completing the next steps in Okta.
5. Go to the **Account Domain Controls** section and click **Submit New Domain**.
6. Submit a request to ngrok support to allow the domain sync with SCIM provisioning in your account.

## Configuring Okta SCIM

Open a new tab in your browser, then log in to the Okta admin console as a user with the ability to manage the ngrok application.

1. In the Okta admin console, navigate to **Applications > Applications**.
2. Open the ngrok app you created.
3. Enable SCIM on the **General** tab in the ngrok application you created under the **Provisioning** section.
4. Switch to the **Provisioning** tab in your Okta application configuration and configure the following:
   - SCIM connector base URL: `https://api.ngrok.com/scim/v2/`
   - Unique identifier field for users: `email`
   - Supported provisioning actions:
     - Push new users
     - Push profile updates
   - Authentication mode: **HTTP Header**
   - Authorization: This is the ngrok API key that you saved or copied earlier
5. Click **Test Connect Configuration** and you should see a success message.

If you get an error message that states no users were returned, there's an error in the configuration. 
Check for typos and leading or trailing spaces.
