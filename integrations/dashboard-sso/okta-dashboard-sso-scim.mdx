This guide walks you through enabling automated user provisioning for your ngrok account via SCIM with Okta.

<Note>
  This document assumes you have already set up [Okta for dashboard SSO](okta-dashboard-sso-oidc).
  After you complete those steps, continue here.
</Note>

## 1. Configure ngrok

Log into your ngrok dashboard as an admin user.

- Navigate to **Settings > Account**.
- Go to the **User Provisioning / SCIM** section and toggle on the **Automated User Provisioning via SCIM 2.0** option.
  This opens a drawer and prompts you to create a new API key.
  Use a unique key just for SCIM.
- Give the API key a descriptive name and assign it either to an administrator user or a Service User.
  Service Users are ideal for this integration because they are not deactivated when a user leaves the account.
- Save the API key somewhere safe or keep this window open while you complete the next steps in Okta.
- Go to the **Account Domain Controls** section and click **Submit New Domain**.
- Submit a request to ngrok support to allow the domain sync with SCIM provisioning in your account.

## 2. Configure Okta SCIM

Open a new browser tab and log in to the Okta admin console as a user who can manage the ngrok application.

- In the Okta admin console, navigate to **Applications > Applications**.
- Open the ngrok app you created.
- Enable SCIM on the **General** tab in the ngrok application you created under the **Provisioning** section.
- Switch to the **Provisioning** tab in your Okta application configuration and configure the following:
  - SCIM connector base URL: `https://api.ngrok.com/scim/v2/`
  - Unique identifier field for users: `email`
  - Supported provisioning actions: Push new users, Push profile updates
  - Authentication mode: **HTTP Header**
  - Authorization: The ngrok API key that you saved or copied earlier
- Click **Test Connect Configuration** and you should see a success message.

If you get an error message that states no users were returned, there's an error in the configuration.
