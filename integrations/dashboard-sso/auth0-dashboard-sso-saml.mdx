This guide walks you through configuring the ngrok dashboard to use Auth0 as an identity provider and enable single sign-on (SSO) with SAML for your ngrok account.
It does not cover configuring an ngrok endpoint to allow your application users to log in using Auth0.

## What you'll need

- Admin access to create new applications in Auth0.
- Admin access to edit your ngrok account settings.
- An [ngrok Enterprise account](https://ngrok.com/pricing).

## 1. Create an Application in Auth0

- From the **Applications** menu, click **Create Application**.
- Name your application, select the application type of Native, and click **Create**.
- Select your application and choose the **Addons** tab.
- Turn SAML2 support on.
- In the popup window on the **Usage** tab, download the Identity Provider Metadata from the provided link.

## 2. Configure SSO for your ngrok account

- Log into your ngrok dashboard and navigate to **Settings > Account**.
- Click **+ New Identity Provider** to add a new SAML identity provider.
- Add a helpful description, and then upload the `metadata.xml` file from Auth0 into the ngrok dashboard.
- In the Options section, select whether to allow users to log into the dashboard directly from their Auth0 dashboard.
- Click **Save**.
  This creates the integration and generates the required URLs for your Auth0 Application.

## 3. Add ngrok URLs to your Auth0 SAML application

- Back in your Auth0 account, select your Application and click the **Addons** tab.
- Select the SAML2 Web App.
- In the popup window, select the **Settings** tab.
- Paste in the Application Callback URL (ACS) obtained from the ngrok IdP settings (SAML Provider/Service Provider, ACS URL).
- In the settings code block window, paste in the following and click **Save**:

  ```json
  {
    "nameIdentifierFormat": "urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress",
    "nameIdentifierProbes": ["email"],
    "mappings": {
      "email": "email"
    }
  }
  ```

You can now log into your ngrok account using Auth0.

By default, your ngrok account allows users to log in with their existing credentials as well as through Auth0 ("Mixed Mode").
After you verify that the integration works, enable **SSO Enforced** in the ngrok dashboard to require all new users to log in through Auth0.
