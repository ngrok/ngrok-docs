---

This guide covers configuring the ngrok dashboard to use Auth0 as an identity provider and enable single sign-on with SAML for your ngrok account.
This should not be confused with configuring an ngrok endpoint to allow your application users to log in using Auth0.

## What you'll need

- Admin access to create new applications in Auth0.
- Admin access to edit your ngrok account settings.
- An ngrok Enterprise account.

## 1. Create an Application in Auth0

1. From the **Applications** menu, click **Create Application**.
2. Name your application, select the application type of Native, and click **Create**.
3. Select your application and choose the **Addons** tab.
4. Turn SAML2 support on.
5. In the popup window on the **Usage** tab, download the Identity Provider Metadata from the provided link.

## 2. Configure single sign-on (SSO) for your ngrok account

1. Log into your ngrok dashboard and navigate to **Settings > Account**.
2. Click **+ New Identity Provider** to add a new SAML identity provider.
3. Add a helpful description, and then upload the `metadata.xml` file from Auth0 into the ngrok dashboard.
4. In the Options section, select whether you'd like to allow users to log into the dashboard directly from their ngrok dashboard.
5. Click **Save**.
Clicking Save creates the integration and generates the required URLs for your Auth0 Application.

## 3. Add the ngrok generated URLs to your Auth0 SAML application

1. Back in your Auth0 account, select your Application and click the **Addons** tab.
2. Select the SAML2 Web App.
3. In the popup window, select the **Settings** tab.
4. Paste in the Application Callback URL (ACS) obtained from the ngrok IdP settings - SAML Provider/Service Provider - ACS URL.
5. In the settings code block window, paste in the following and click **Save**:

   ```json
   {
     "nameIdentifierFormat": "urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress",
     "nameIdentifierProbes": [
       "email"
     ],
     "mappings": {
       "email": "email"
     }
   }
   ```

You should now be configured to log into your ngrok account using Auth0.

By default, your ngrok account allows users to log in with their existing credentials as well as through Auth0 ("Mixed Mode").
Once you verify that everything is working properly with your integration, you can enable **SSO Enforced** in the ngrok Dashboard, which requires all new users to log in through Auth0 for their ngrok account.
