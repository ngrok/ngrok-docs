## Traffic Logs

When network traffic transits through your endpoints, like HTTP requests or TCP
connections, ngrok emits protocol-specific Traffic Logs. Because Traffic Logs are
often high cardinality, they support the ability to select which fields to capture as
well as the ability to specify a [CEL filter expression](/obs/events/#filters) to
limit which logs are captured.

| Event                                                  | Description                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| [`http_request_complete.v0`](#http-request-completev0) | Triggers when an HTTP request completes.              |
| [`tcp_connection_closed.v0`](#tcp-connection-closedv0) | Triggers when a TCP connection to an endpoint closes. |

## Audit Logs

When you make configuration changes to your account ngrok emits Audit Logs. These logs
can help you get visibility into when objects like Domains, API Keys, and IP Policies are
created, updated, or deleted within your ngrok account.
