Troubleshoot and monitor traffic flowing through your endpoints to understand what was sent, received, and how it behaved.
Inspect requests and responses in real time with Traffic Inspector, or export traffic events to your own tools for retention, analysis, and alerting.

## Features

- [Traffic Inspector](/obs/traffic-inspection/) - Real-time view of HTTP traffic with request replay capabilities.
