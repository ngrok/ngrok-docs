With Traffic Policy, you can prevent obsolete and potentially vulnerable browsers, SDKs, or CLI tools like `curl` from attempting to access your API.

This rule:

1. Uses [the `conn.tls.version` connection variable](https://ngrok.com/docs/traffic-policy/variables/connection/#conntlsversion) to check the incoming request's TLS version.
1. Rejects versions below `1.3` with a `401 Unauthorized` response.

<ConfigExample
	config={{
		on_http_request: [
			{
				name: "Reject requests using old TLS versions",
				expressions: ["conn.tls.version < '1.3'"],
				actions: [
					{
						type: "custom-response",
						config: {
							status_code: 401,
							body: "Unauthorized: TLS version too old",
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>

See [the `custom-response` Traffic Policy action docs](/traffic-policy/actions/custom-response/) for more information.
