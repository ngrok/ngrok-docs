# Run a local Kubernetes Cluster

You can install the ngrok Kubernetes operator in a locally running Kubernetes cluster rather than paying for one from a cloud provider.

This is useful for:

- Quickly getting started trying out the ngrok Operator
- Local development & testing
- Connecting containerized workloads on your local machine to your ngrok infrastructure
- Faster iteration cycles without cloud latency

Running Kubernetes inside containers has the benefits of being quick and simple to setup compared to a bare-metal installation and keeps the Kubernetes environment more isolated from the dependencies and other applications on your computer.
This is not a recommendation for how you should productionize your Kubernetes setup, but rather a guide on getting an easy to use local environment setup for development and testing.
The following sections outline various options for running Kubernetes inside Docker containers on your local machine, but you can run the ngrok Kubernetes operator in any Kubernetes cluster you like.

## Choosing a Container Runtime

Before setting up a local Kubernetes cluster, you need a container runtime. The container runtime is responsible for running containers, managing their lifecycle, and handling networking.
If you don't already have a container runtime such as Docker installed, choose one from the options below.

| Runtime                                                           | OS Support                        | Architecture Support          | Description                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)          | Linux, ⚠️ Windows (WSL2 required) | x86_64, ARM64                 | Standard CLI-based runtime. Great for users who need a lightweight container runtime without a GUI.                           |
| [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) | Linux, macOS, Windows             | x86_64, ARM64 (Apple Silicon) | GUI-based runtime. Great for developers who want an easy-to-use experience with a dashboard.                                  |
| [Containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd)            | Linux, Windows                    | x86_64, ARM64, s390x, ppc64le | Minimalist, Kubernetes-native runtime. Great for Kubernetes users who need a lightweight runtime without Docker dependencies. |
| [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima)                      | Linux, macOS                      | x86_64, ARM64 (Apple Silicon) | macOS-native alternative to Docker Desktop. Great for Mac users looking for a lightweight and fast Docker-compatible runtime. |

## Choosing a Cluster Provider

Select one of the following options for running Kubernetes inside containers on your local machine.

| Provider                                                          | Benefits                                                                                                          | Things to consider                                                     |

    When creating a k3d cluster, the config is automatically added to your Kubeconfig file so you are ready to go immediately.

    #### List running clusters
    ```bash
    k3d cluster list
    ```

    #### Delete a k3d cluster
    ```bash
    k3d cluster delete my-cluster
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="minikube" label="Minikube" default>

    #### Create a Minikube cluster
    ```bash
    minikube start
    ```

    When creating a Minikube cluster, the config is automatically added to your Kubeconfig file so you are ready to go immediately.

    #### List running clusters
    ```bash
    minikube profile list
    ```

    #### Delete a Minikube cluster
    ```bash
    minikube delete
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="kind" label="Kind" default>

    #### Create a kind cluster
    ```bash

    <TabItem value="microk8s" label="Microk8s" default>

    #### Create a Microk8s cluster
    ```bash
    microk8s start
    ```

    When creating a Microk8s cluster, the config is **NOT** automatically added to your Kubeconfig file, so you can use the following command
    to add it.

    ```bash
    microk8s config > $KUBECONFIG
    ```

    #### List running clusters
    ```bash
    microk8s stop

## Managing Kubernetes Contexts

When working with multiple Kubernetes clusters (e.g., Minikube, k3d, kind, MicroK8s, cloud clusters), it is important to manage **kubeconfig contexts** efficiently.
A **context** in Kubernetes determines:

- **Which cluster** `kubectl` is communicating with.
- **Which user credentials** to use for authentication.
- **Which namespace** is the default for commands.

Kubernetes stores this information in the **kubeconfig file** (default location: `~/.kube/config`).
The `$KUBECONFIG` environment variable is used by `kubectl` to know where your configuraiton file is.
If you would like to store it somewhere else, or use different files for different clusters, you can modify the `$KUBECONFIG` variable.

### Viewing the Current Context

To check which Kubernetes cluster you are currently using:

```bash
kubectl config current-context
```

This returns the active context, which tells kubectl which cluster and credentials are being used.

### Listing All Contexts

To see all available Kubernetes contexts in your kubeconfig:

```bash
kubectl config get-contexts
```

This will display a list of available contexts, including:

- Cluster Name (e.g., minikube, kind-my-cluster, k3d-my-cluster).
- User Credentials.
- Current Context (marked with \*).

### Switching Between Contexts

To switch from one Kubernetes cluster to another:

```bash
kubectl config use-context my-cluster
```

### Setting a Default Namespace for a Context

By default, kubectl uses the default namespace. You can change the default namespace for a specific context:

```bash
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=my-namespace
```

Or, specify a namespace when switching to a different context:

```bash
kubectl config set-context my-cluster --namespace=custom-namespace
```

### Deleting a Context

If you no longer need a specific context, you can remove it from your kubeconfig:

```bash
kubectl config delete-context <context-name>
```

This does not delete the cluster itself, only its entry from your kubeconfig.

### Merging Multiple Kubeconfig Files

If you have multiple kubeconfig files (e.g., from cloud providers and local clusters), you can merge them:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config:~/.kube/k3d-config:~/.kube/microk8s-config
kubectl config view --merge --flatten > ~/.kube/config-merged
mv ~/.kube/config-merged ~/.kube/config
```

This consolidates multiple different cluster credentials into a single kubeconfig file.
