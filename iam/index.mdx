description: Learn about ngrok's identity and access management system for managing credentials, enforcing access controls, and federating identity.
---

ngrok IAM helps you manage access to your account. 
Give each person or system their own credentials, rotate or revoke access when needed, and see every change tied to a specific identity in audit logs. 
You can also set up single sign-on (SSO) with your identity provider and manage multiple ngrok accounts from one user.

## Concepts

<Columns cols={1}>
	<Card title="Users" href="/iam/users/" horizontal>
		Manage human users who can log into the dashboard, start agents, create endpoints, and access the API.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Service Users" href="/iam/service-users/" horizontal>
		Create dedicated credentials for automated processes that interact with your ngrok account programmatically.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Role-based Access Control" href="/iam/rbac/" horizontal>
		Enforce least-privilege access by restricting what actions each user can take within your account.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Single Sign-On" href="/iam/sso/" horizontal>
		Federate identity with your IdP and enable SSO authentication for dashboard access.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Account Domain Controls" href="/iam/domain-controls/" horizontal>
		Enforce organization-wide account usage by requiring users with your email domain to use your account.
