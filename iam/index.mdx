description: Learn about ngrok's identity and access management system for managing credentials, enforcing access controls, and federating identity.
---

ngrok includes a robust identity and access management (IAM) system that enables you to issue, rotate and revoke unique credentials for each principal in your account and enforce least-privilege access. 
All mutations are attributed to distinct principals in audit logs, and you can configure single sign-on (SSO) to federate identity with your IdP. 
You can also administrate multiple ngrok accounts with a single user.

## Concepts

	<Card title="Service Users" href="/iam/service-users/" horizontal>
		Create dedicated credentials for automated processes that interact with your ngrok account programmatically.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Role-based Access Control" href="/iam/rbac/" horizontal>
		Enforce least-privilege access by restricting what actions each user can take within your account.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Single Sign-On" href="/iam/sso/" horizontal>
		Federate identity with your IdP and enable SSO authentication for dashboard access.
