The ngrok Kubernetes Operator always forwards its traffic. All of our other
examples show the most common forwarding case: a `Service` object that defines
a label selector of matching pods to forward traffic to.

But you can also [forward to an explicit set of IP
addresses](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#services-without-selectors)
on the same network using `Service` and `EndpointSlice` objects.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: example-service
spec:
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
---
apiVersion: discovery.k8s.io/v1
kind: EndpointSlice
metadata:
  name: example-service-1
  labels:
    kubernetes.io/service-name: example-service
addressType: IPv4
ports:
  - name: "http"
    appProtocol: http
    protocol: TCP
    port: 80
endpoints:
  - addresses:
      - "192.168.1.2"

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example-ingress
  annotations:
    k8s.ngrok.com/modules: ngrok-module-set
spec:
  ingressClassName: ngrok
  rules:
    - host: app.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: example-service
                port:
                  number: 80
```
