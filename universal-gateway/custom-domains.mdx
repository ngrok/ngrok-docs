description: Learn how to use your own custom domain with ngrok.
---

This guide shows you how to use any domain name you already own, such as `app.your-domain.com`, with ngrok.

<Note>
ngrok is not a domain registrar; you must already own a domain name to use it with ngrok.
</Note>

## 1. Add your domain in ngrok

On your dashboard's [Domain page](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains), click the **New Domain** button to add your domain to your ngrok account.
After it's been added, you'll be given a `CNAME` value such as `exampledata.otherdata.ngrok-cname.com`.
Copy this for the next step.

<Info>
You can also add a domain via the [ngrok API](/api-reference/reserveddomains/list).
The `CNAME` will be in the `"cname_target"` field of [the response object](/api-reference/reserveddomains/list).
</Info>

## 2. Add the CNAME record to your domain

In a new browser tab, navigate to your domain hosting provider's dashboard and create a CNAME record.
(Check your provider's support content if you're unsure how to do this.)
When configuring the record, use the following values:

- **type**: `CNAME`
- **name**: `@`
- **value**: the `CNAME` value you copied from ngrok

<Tip title="Test your CNAME record">
Using a tool like [`dig`](https://www.digwebinterface.com/) or [`nslookup`](https://www.nslookup.io/), you can test your CNAME record in the terminal.
</Tip>

## 3. Start an endpoint using your domain

To start an agent endpoint at your domain, run the following command in your terminal, replacing `your-domain-here.example.com` with the domain you added in the ngrok dashboard:

```bash
ngrok http --url your-domain-here.example.com 8080
```

## Wildcard domains

If you bring your own [wildcard domain](/universal-gateway/domains#wildcard-domains) (such as`*.example.com`), you must create a second `CNAME` record with your domain host for [wildcard TLS Certificate provisioning](/universal-gateway/tls-certificates/#wildcard-domains).

## Apex domains

ngrok does not currently support apex domains.

## Using custom domains with TCP endpoints

Public TCP endpoints are assigned randomly on an ngrok-controlled hostname with a randomly assigned port.
You cannot choose the hostname or select the port.

However, you can simulate a customized hostname by creating a `CNAME` record to the hostname of your assigned TCP address.
If you do so, be aware that all ports on that hostname—even those provisioned to other accounts—will then be available on your domain.

For example, if your TCP address is `5.tcp.ngrok.io:12345`, you could create the following `CNAME` record:

```bash
CNAME tcp.mydomain.com -> 5.tcp.ngrok.io
```

Then you can access that TCP endpoint with:

```bash
telnet tcp.mydomain.com 12345
```
