---

ngrok's platform is a universal gateway: it provides all of the building blocks you need to create API and device gateways, identity-aware proxies, and site-to-site connectivity.
Across all use cases it secures, accelerates, and protects your applications.
Additionally:

- It works with software running locally or in the cloud, and with devices running on-premises or distributed in the field.
- It supports [TCP](/universal-gateway/tcp/), [TLS](/universal-gateway/tls/), and [HTTP/S](/universal-gateway/http/).
- You can deliver traffic to internal and public APIs, and orchestrate traffic across your devices.
- It's globally distributed by default and provides support for multiple environments with minimal configuration.

## Use cases

Here are some of the most common use cases, from the [examples collection](/universal-gateway/examples/):

    <Card title="Route to endpoints by geography" icon="link" href="/universal-gateway/examples/route-by-geography/">
        Forward requests based on IP geolocation data for reduced latency or country-specific features such as currency conversion or language localization.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Create identity-based rate limits" icon="link" href="/universal-gateway/examples/pre-tier-requests/">
        Pre-tier requests based on your packaging or pricing model.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Secure a public Minecraft server" icon="link" href="/universal-gateway/examples/minecraft/">
        Restrict server access to a specific set of IP addresses.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Intercept and rewrite headers" icon="link" href="/universal-gateway/examples/rewrite-headers-redirects/">
        Intercept 302 redirect headers to preserve UX and agent behavior.
    </Card>

## Concepts

Here are the main concepts you should understand to make the most of the universal gateway:

- [Domains](#)
- [Endpoints](/universal-gateway/endpoints/)
- [Protocols](/universal-gateway/protocols/)
- [Bindings](/universal-gateway/bindings/)
- [Pooling](/universal-gateway/endpoint-pooling/)
- [Global Load Balancer](#)
- [DDoS protection](#)

## Features

Here are the primary building blocks of the universal gateway:

  <Card title="Second card" icon="panel-right-close">
    [**Traffic observability**](/obs/): capture and replay requests and responses.
  </Card>
    <Card title="First card" icon="panel-left-close">
   [**Identity and access management**](/iam/): manage credentials for human users and automated processes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Second card" icon="panel-right-close">
    [**Kubernetes support**](/k8s/): ingress and cross-platform Gateway API configuration resources.

## What's next?

- Proceed to the guides section to get started with ngrok as an [API gateway](/guides/api-gateway/get-started/), [device gateway](/guides/device-gateway/agent/), [identity-aware proxy](/guides/identity-aware-proxy/securing-with-oauth/), or for [site-to-site connectivity](/guides/identity-aware-proxy/securing-with-oauth/).
- Check out the [Universal Gateway examples collection](/universal-gateway/examples/) to see how to implement even more common use cases.
