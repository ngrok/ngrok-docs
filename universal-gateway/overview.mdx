---

ngrok is a universal gateway platform that gives you the building blocks to create powerful API gateways, device gateways, identity-aware proxies, and site-to-site connectivity.
Across all use cases it secures, accelerates, and protects your applications.
Additionally:

- It works with software running locally or in the cloud, and with devices running on-premises or distributed in the field.
- It supports [TCP](/universal-gateway/tcp/), [TLS](/universal-gateway/tls/), and [HTTP/S](/universal-gateway/http/).
- You can deliver traffic to internal and public APIs, and [orchestrate traffic](/traffic-policy/) across your devices.
- It's globally distributed by default and provides support for multiple environments with minimal configuration.

## Features

- [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/) - Filter, match, manage, and orchestrate traffic to your endpoints.
- [Traffic observability](/obs/) - Capture and replay requests and responses.
- [Identity and access management](/iam/) - Manage credentials for human users and automated processes.
- [Kubernetes support](/k8s/) - Ingress and cross-platform Gateway API configuration resources.
- [Secure tunnels](/agent/) - Expose local services or connect devices to ngrok's global network.

## What's next?

- Proceed to the guides section to get started with ngrok as an [API gateway](/guides/api-gateway/get-started/), [device gateway](/guides/device-gateway/agent/), [identity-aware proxy](/guides/identity-aware-proxy/securing-with-oauth/), or for [site-to-site connectivity](/guides/identity-aware-proxy/securing-with-oauth/).
- Check out the [Universal Gateway examples collection](/universal-gateway/examples/) to see how to implement even more common use cases.
