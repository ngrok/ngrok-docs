---

ngrok is a universal gateway platform that gives you the building blocks to create powerful API and device gateways, identity-aware proxies, and site-to-site connectivity.
Across all use cases it secures, accelerates, and protects your applications.
Additionally:

- It works with software running locally or in the cloud, and with devices running on-premises or distributed in the field.
- It supports [TCP](/universal-gateway/tcp/), [TLS](/universal-gateway/tls/), and [HTTP/S](/universal-gateway/http/).
- You can deliver traffic to internal and public APIs, and orchestrate traffic across your devices.
- It's globally distributed by default and provides support for multiple environments with minimal configuration.

## Concepts

Here are the core elements you should familiarize yourself with to make the most of the universal gateway:

<Columns cols={1}>
	<Card title="Endpoints" href="/universal-gateway/endpoints/" horizontal>
		Create and manage endpoints to orchestrate traffic to your services.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Domains" href="/universal-gateway/domains/" horizontal>
		Create public endpoints with hostnames matching your domain and configure
		domain-level behaviors.
	</Card>
	<Card
		title="TCP Addresses"
		href="/universal-gateway/tcp-addresses/"
		horizontal
	>
		Create public TCP endpoints on a fixed hostname and port.
	</Card>
	<Card
		title="TLS Certificates"
		href="/universal-gateway/tls-certificates/"
		horizontal
	>
		Automatically manage TLS certificates for terminating TLS connections to
		your endpoints.
	</Card>
</Columns>

## Features

Here are the primary building blocks of the universal gateway:

- [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/) - Filter, match, manage, and orchestrate traffic to your endpoints.
- [Traffic observability](/obs/) - Capture and replay requests and responses.
- [Identity and access management](/iam/) - Manage credentials for human users and automated processes.
- [Kubernetes support](/k8s/) - Ingress and cross-platform Gateway API configuration resources.
- [Secure tunnels](/agent/) - Expose local services or connect devices to ngrok's global network.

## Use cases

Here are some of the most common use cases, from the [examples collection](/universal-gateway/examples/):

<Columns cols={2}>
	<Card
		title="Route to endpoints by geography"
		icon="globe"
		href="/universal-gateway/examples/route-by-geography/"
	>
		Forward requests based on IP geolocation data for reduced latency or
		country-specific features.
	</Card>
	<Card
		title="Create identity-based rate limits"
		icon="user"
		href="/universal-gateway/examples/pre-tier-requests/"
	>
		Pre-tier requests based on your packaging or pricing model.
	</Card>
	<Card
		title="Secure a public Minecraft server"
		icon="gamepad"
		href="/universal-gateway/examples/minecraft/"
	>
		Restrict server access to a specific set of IP addresses.
	</Card>
	<Card
		title="Intercept and rewrite headers"
		icon="pencil"
		href="/universal-gateway/examples/rewrite-headers-redirects/"
	>
		Intercept 302 redirect headers to preserve UX and agent behavior.
	</Card>
</Columns>

## What's next?

- Proceed to the guides section to get started with ngrok as an [API gateway](/guides/api-gateway/get-started/), [device gateway](/guides/device-gateway/agent/), [identity-aware proxy](/guides/identity-aware-proxy/securing-with-oauth/), or for [site-to-site connectivity](/guides/identity-aware-proxy/securing-with-oauth/).
- Check out the [Universal Gateway examples collection](/universal-gateway/examples/) to see how to implement even more common use cases.
