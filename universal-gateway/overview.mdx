---

ngrok's platform is a universal gateway: it provides all of the building blocks you need to create API and device gateways, identity-aware proxies, and site-to-site connectivity.
Across all use cases it secures, accelerates, and protects your applications.
Additionally:

- It works with software running locally or in the cloud, and with devices running on-premises or distributed in the field.
- It supports [TCP](/universal-gateway/tcp/), [TLS](/universal-gateway/tls/), and [HTTP/S](/universal-gateway/http/).
- You can deliver traffic to internal and public APIs, and orchestrate traffic across your devices.
- It's globally distributed by default and provides support for multiple environments with minimal configuration.

## Use cases

Here are some of the most common use cases, from the [examples collection](/universal-gateway/examples/):

	>
		Forward requests based on IP geolocation data for reduced latency or
		country-specific features.

	<Card

		Pre-tier requests based on your packaging or pricing model.

	<Card

	>
		Restrict server access to a specific set of IP addresses.

	<Card
		title="Intercept and rewrite headers"

		href="/universal-gateway/examples/rewrite-headers-redirects/"
	>
		Intercept 302 redirect headers to preserve UX and agent behavior.

## Concepts

Here are the main concepts you should understand to make the most of the universal gateway:

- [Endpoints](/universal-gateway/endpoints/) - Create and manage endpoints to orchestrate traffic to your services.
- [Domains](/universal-gateway/domains/) - Create public endpoints with hostnames matching your domain and configure domain-level behaviors.
- [Pooling](/universal-gateway/endpoint-pooling/) - Load-balance traffic for scalability, failover, or to do blue/green and canary deployments.
- [Global Load Balancer](/universal-gateway/global-load-balancer/) - Choose which points of presence handle traffic to a domain's matching endpoints.
- [DDoS protection](/universal-gateway/ddos-protection/) - Protect your endpoints from DDoS attacks.

## Features

Here are the primary building blocks of the universal gateway:

## What's next?

- Proceed to the guides section to get started with ngrok as an [API gateway](/guides/api-gateway/get-started/), [device gateway](/guides/device-gateway/agent/), [identity-aware proxy](/guides/identity-aware-proxy/securing-with-oauth/), or for [site-to-site connectivity](/guides/identity-aware-proxy/securing-with-oauth/).
- Check out the [Universal Gateway examples collection](/universal-gateway/examples/) to see how to implement even more common use cases.
