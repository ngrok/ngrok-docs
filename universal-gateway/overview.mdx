---

ngrok's platform is a universal gateway: It provides all of the building blocks you need to create API and device gateways, identity-aware proxies, and site-to-site connectivity.
Across all use cases, it secures, accelerates, and protects your applications.

- It works with software running locally or in the cloud, and with devices running on-premises or distributed in the field.
- It supports [TCP](/universal-gateway/tcp/), [TLS](/universal-gateway/tls/),] and [HTTP/S](/universal-gateway/http/).
- You can deliver traffic to internal and public APIs, and orchestrate traffic across your devices.
- It's globally distributed by default and provides support for multiple environments with minimal configuration.

## Use cases

Here are some of the most common use cases for the Universal Gateway, from the [examples collection](/universal-gateway/examples/):

- [**The front door pattern**](/universal-gateway/examples/front-door-pattern/): Use a public endpoint as the entrance to all your upstream servicesâ€”for example, an employee portal.
- [**Route to endpoints by geography**](/universal-gateway/examples/route-by-geography/): Forward requests based on IP geolocation data for reduced latency or country-specific features such as currency conversion or language localization.
- [**Create identity-based rate limits**](/universal-gateway/examples/pre-tier-requests/): Pre-tier requests based on your packaging or pricing model.
- [**Secure a public Minecraft server**](/universal-gateway/examples/minecraft/): Restrict server access to a specific set of IP addresses.
- [**Intercept and rewrite headers**](/universal-gateway/examples/rewrite-headers-redirects/): Intercept 302 redirect headers to preserve UX and agent behavior.

## Features

Here are the primary building blocks of the universal gateway:

- [**Traffic Policy**](/traffic-policy/): filter, match, manage, and orchestrate traffic to your endpoints.
- [**Traffic observability**](/obs/): capture and replay requests and responses.
- [**Identity and access management**](/iam/): manage credentials for human users and automated processes.
- [**Kubernetes support**](/k8s/): ingress and cross-platform Gateway API configuration resources.

## Concepts

Here are the main concepts you should understand to make the most of the universal gateway:

- [Endpoints](/universal-gateway/endpoints/)
- [Protocols](/universal-gateway/protocols/)
- [Bindings](/universal-gateway/bindings/)
- [Pooling](/universal-gateway/endpoint-pooling/)
