title: Agent Endpoints
description: Learn about creating endpoints managed by Secure Tunnel agents.
---

Agent Endpoints are public or internal Endpoints created by Secure Tunnel agents, which include any of the following:

- [The Agent CLI](/agent/)
- [The Kubernetes Operator](/k8s/)
- [Agent SDKs](/agent-sdks) in multiple supported languages

Agent Endpoints live for the lifetime of, and forward connections to, the agent process that started them.

## Get started

To set up your first Agent endpoint, see [the Getting Started with ngrok](/getting-started/) guide.

## Use cases

Agent endpoints are a good choice when you want to:

- **Put applications running anywhere online**.
  - Your app could be running in a anywhere, e.g. AWS, Digital Ocean, in a container or a VM, on your laptop, in your home lab, etc.
- **Create connectivity to apps running in ephemeral environments like CI**.
- **Ensure that an endpoint goes offline when your process or machine is disconnected**.
- **You can use agent endpoints to create connectivity to apps running on your localhost, an IoT device in the field, or an EC2 instance**.
  - Because agent endpoints are created via [Secure Tunnel agents](/agent/), they are excellent for connecting to apps running on all networks, even those behind a NAT.

## Differences from Cloud Endpoints

<Note>
See the [Endpoint Types](/universal-gateway/types) page for a full comparison between Agent and Cloud Endpoints.
</Note>

- **Lifetime** - Unlike Cloud Endpoints, Agent Endpoints are online only as
  long as the agent process that started them remains running and connected to
  the ngrok cloud service.
- **Agent Authoritative** - Agent Endpoints are created, managed and configured
  by the Secure Tunnels agent that started them. The agent is authoritative
  about Agent Endpoints it has started and the dashboard or API provides a
  read-only view of them. Cloud Endpoints, by contrast, are created, managed, and
  configured centrally by the API or dashboard.
- **URLs** - When creating an agent endpoint, you may ask the ngrok cloud
  service to choose a random URL for it.
- **Forwarding** - Agent Endpoints implicitly forward their traffic to the
  agent that started them.
- **Traffic Policy** - Traffic Policy is optional for agent endpoints. When you
  do specify a Traffic Policy for an Agent Endpoint, any traffic that is not
  terminated by the policy is sent to the agent that created the endpoint.
- **API** - Agents Endpoints' API representation specifies `type: agent` and its
  `tunnel_session` reference points to the Secure Tunnels session that it was
  created by.

## Protocols, Binding and Pooling

- **Protocols** - Agent endpoints support all [Endpoint
  Protocols](/universal-gateway/protocols) (`http`, `https`, `tcp`
  and `tls`).
- **Bindings** - Agent endpoints support all [Endpoint
  Bindings](/universal-gateway/bindings) (`public`,
  `internal` and `kubernetes`).
- **Pooling** - Agent endpoints support [Endpoint
  Pooling](/universal-gateway/endpoint-pooling/). They may also pool with
  themselves and with cloud endpoints.

## API

Agent Endpoints can be managed programmatically via:

- [Agent SDKs](/agent-sdks/)
- [Agent API](/agent/api/)
- [Kubernetes Operator](/k8s/installation/helm)

Agent Endpoints are also included in a read-only capacity via:

- [`/endpoints` API Resource](/api-reference/endpoints/list) of the [API](/api)

## Pricing

Agent endpoints are available on all plans. Consult the [Endpoints
Pricing](/universal-gateway/endpoints/#pricing) documentation for
billing details.
