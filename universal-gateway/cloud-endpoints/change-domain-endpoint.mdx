title: How to Change a Cloud Endpoint Domain
description: How to use the ngrok API to change the URL of your Cloud Endpoint with zero downtime.
---

If you want to change the [matching domain](/universal-gateway/domains/) for your active Cloud Endpoint without any downtime to your services, you can use the [ngrok API](/api/) to update its values instead of deleting and recreating the endpoint in the dashboard.

## What you'll need

- An [ngrok API key](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/api-keys).
- An active cloud endpoint.

## 1. Configure your API key

If this is your first time using the ngrok API, add your API key to your config file:

```bash
ngrok config add-api-key $YOUR_API_KEY
```

You can verify that the API key is set by running:

```bash
ngrok api credentials list
```

You should see a response with information about your authtoken.

## 2. Get the ID of the endpoint you want to modify

Next you'll need your endpoint's ID.
To see a complete list of your endpoints, run:

```bash
ngrok api endpoints list
```

Find the endpoint you want to modify and note its ID, which is a long character string beginning with `ep_`.

You can also find your endpoint ID in the [Endpoints section of the dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/endpoints).

## 3. Update the endpoint with the new domain

Run the following command to change your cloud endpoint's URL, replacing `$YOUR_ENDPOINT_ID` and `$YOUR_DOMAIN` with their respective values from the previous steps:

```bash
ngrok api endpoints update $YOUR_ENDPOINT_ID --url $YOUR_DOMAIN
```

## 4. Test your new endpoint URL

To verify that the change was successful, run:

```bash
ngrok api endpoints get $YOUR_ENDPOINT_ID
```

You should see the new URL in the output, confirming that your cloud endpoint is now running there.
