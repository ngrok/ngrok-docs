[Cloud endpoints](/universal-gateway/cloud-endpoints/) are created via the
ngrok Dashboard or [API](/api/). They are persistent and live until they are
deleted. [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/) controls how a Cloud Endpoint
handles traffic.

[Create an HTTPS Cloud Endpoint](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/endpoints/new)
which returns a `Hello world!` 200 OK response.
