ngrok's globally distributed cloud service runs on points of presence all
around the world to enable fast, low latency traffic to your applications.

ngrok continuously expands regional points of presence. As each new
point of presence is added, your applications become faster for global customers without
any changes.

## Usage

The table of region codes above are used throughout the product to communicate
which points of presence are being used by a particular feature and to allow
you to configure pieces of the product to use specific points of presence.
Region codes are used by the following features:

- [Global Load Balancer](/universal-gateway/global-load-balancer/)
- [`conn.server_region` Traffic Policy variable](/traffic-policy/variables/connection/#connserver-region)
- [`region` Agent Configuration property](/agent/config/v2/#region)
- [Domain Global Load Balancer configuration](/universal-gateway/domains#global-load-balancer)

They are correspondingly used in the following APIs:

- [Domain `region` property](/api-reference/reserveddomains/list)
- [TCP Address `region` property](/api-reference/reservedaddrs/list)
- [Tunnel Sessions `region` property](/api-reference/tunnelsessions/list)
