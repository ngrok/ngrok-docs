n8n allows you to self-host, which is great when you're testing workflows, but when you're ready to turn your instance into a production-ready automation solution and don't want to buy a domain or pay for hosting, you might feel lost.

ngrok works with the [self-hosted and enterprise editions](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/) of n8n, including Docker, Docker Compose, and npm-based installs, to make them securely available on the public internet.
That way, you can share n8n with colleagues or accept webhooks to fire off workflows.

## 1: Reserve a domain

<ReserveDomain domain="https://your-n8n-instance.ngrok.app" />

## 2: Run n8n + ngrok

To run n8n and ngrok in Docker, you can either use Docker Compose to run both services together or run them as separate containers. In both cases, you can use a `.env` file to store configuration values.

Replace `NGROK_DOMAIN` and `NGROK_AUTHTOKEN` with your values, as well as `N8N_HOST` and `WEBHOOK_URL` with your reserved domain. If you don't already have an authtoken, you can find it in your dashboard [here](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).

```js .env highlight={1,2,5,6}
NGROK_DOMAIN=your-n8n-instance.ngrok.app
NGROK_AUTHTOKEN=your-ngrok-authtoken
N8N_ENFORCE_SETTINGS_FILE_PERMISSIONS=true
N8N_RUNNERS_ENABLED=true
N8N_HOST=your-n8n-instance.ngrok.app
WEBHOOK_URL="https://your-n8n-instance.ngrok.app/"
TZ="Europe/London"
GENERIC_TIMEZONE="Europe/London"
```

Once that file is saved, you can either create a `docker-compose.yaml` file to run both services together or run them as separate containers with `docker run`.

<CodeGroup>

```yaml docker-compose.yaml
services:
  n8n:
    image: docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:5678:5678"
    env_file: .env
    volumes:
      - n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n

  ngrok:
    image: ngrok/ngrok:latest
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      - n8n
    env_file: .env
    command: http --url=${NGROK_DOMAIN} n8n:5678
    ports:
      - "4040:4040" # ngrok web UI

volumes:
  n8n_data:
```

```bash docker
docker network create n8n

docker run -d --name n8n \
  --network n8n \
  -p 5678:5678 \
  -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n \
  --env-file .env \
  docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n

docker run -d \
  --name ngrok \
  --network n8n \
  -p 4040:4040 \
  --env-file .env \
  ngrok/ngrok:latest http --url=your-n8n-instance.ngrok.app n8n:5678
```

</CodeGroup>

If you're using Docker Compose, you'll need to run the following command from the same directory where your `docker-compose.yaml` file is located.

```bash
docker compose up
```

## 3. Try out your n8n endpoint

You can now access your n8n instance at the domain you reserved in step 1. Visit
it in your browser to go through the first time n8n admin account setup.

## Optional: Secure your n8n dashboard with Traffic Policy

Even though n8n comes with built-in user administration, you can protect the sign-in page from automated attacks by restricting access to only trusted IPs.

Go to our [IP address helper tool](https://ipv4.ngrok.com/) to get your public IP address.

Next, create a file named `n8n.yaml` on the same system where n8n runs and paste in the following policy, replacing `$YOUR_IP`.

```yaml n8n.yaml
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: restrict-ips
        config:
          enforce: true
          allow:
            - "$YOUR_IP/32"
```

<Info>
**What's happening here?**

This policy applies the [`restrict-ips`](/traffic-policy/actions/restrict-ips) Traffic Policy action and allows only
devices with a matching IP address to access your n8n instance.
All other requests are denied at ngrok's network without reaching your service.
</Info>

Then make the following modifications to your `docker-compose.yaml` file to mount the policy file into the ngrok container and tell ngrok to use it.

<CodeGroup>

```yaml docker-compose.yaml highlight={17-19}
services:
  n8n:
    image: docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:5678:5678"
    env_file: .env
    volumes:
      - n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n

  ngrok:
    image: ngrok/ngrok:latest
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      - n8n
    env_file: .env
    command: http --url=${NGROK_DOMAIN} --traffic-policy-file /etc/n8n.yaml n8n:5678
    volumes:
      - ./n8n.yaml:/etc/n8n.yaml
    ports:
      - "4040:4040" # ngrok web UI

volumes:
  n8n_data:
```

```bash docker highlight={7-8}
docker kill ngrok
docker run -d \
  --name ngrok \
  --network n8n \
  -p 4040:4040 \
  --env-file .env \
  -v $(pwd)/n8n.yaml:/etc/n8n.yaml \
  ngrok/ngrok:latest http --url=your-n8n-instance.ngrok.app --traffic-policy-file /etc/n8n.yaml n8n:5678
```

</CodeGroup>

If you're using Docker Compose, restart your setup to apply the new policy.

```bash
docker compose down
docker compose up
```

## Optional: Enforce verification on incoming webhooks

If you want to receive webhooks from external services, but also want to control precisely which services can send these requests and during what conditions, you can use the [`verify-webhooks` action](/traffic-policy/actions/verify-webhook).

For example, if you want to verify a webhook from GitHub, you can edit your `n8n.yaml` file and paste in the policy below.
Replace `$WORKFLOW_UUID` with your workflow's path and `$SECRET` with the secret you configured when you created your webhook.

```yaml n8n.yaml
on_http_request:
  - expressions:
      - "req.url.path.contains('/webhook/$WORKFLOW_UUID')"
    actions:
      - type: verify-webhook
        config:
          provider: github
          secret: $SECRET
```

<Info>
**What's happening here?**

This policy filters for _only_ traffic that contains the specific `/webhook/$WORKFLOW_UUID` path. It then verifies that the traffic both originates from GitHub (or another [supported provider](/traffic-policy/actions/verify-webhook/#supported-providers)) and contains the appropriate secret.
</Info>

You'll need to restart your ngrok container to apply the new policy.

### Configure both IP restrictions and webhook verification

If you configured IP restrictions earlier, and _then_ set up webhook verification, you'll find that your webhooks won't work because you haven't added the provider's IP to your `restrict-ips` action to allow them.
Because it's next to impossible to identify all the IPs where a provider's webhooks might come from, it's easier to disable IP restrictions on the `/webhooks/` path.

Edit your `n8n.yaml` file with the policy below.

```yaml n8n.yaml
on_http_request:
  - expressions:
      - "req.url.path.contains('/webhook/$WORKFLOW_UUID')"
    actions:
      - type: verify-webhook
        config:
          provider: github
          secret: $SECRET

  - expressions:
      - "!req.url.path.contains('/webhook/')"
    actions:
      - type: restrict-ips
        config:
          enforce: true
          allow:
            - "$YOUR_IP/32"
```

<Info>
**What's happening here?**

This policy first verifies any incoming webhooks as before. Then, the policy applies IP restrictions to only traffic _not_ to the `/webhook/` path, which allows your webhooks provider's request to reach n8n successfully.
