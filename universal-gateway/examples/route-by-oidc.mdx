With ngrok, you can use OpenID Connect to do more than authenticate requests—you can also use the data returned by your OIDC provider to route requests to specific upstream services.

This pattern allows you to grant credentialed users and remote devices access to services on your internal ngrok network without maintaining a complex routing topology.
Example use cases include internal management UIs or API services.

## 1. Set up your OIDC provider

You can use any provider with the [`oidc` Traffic Policy action](/traffic-policy/actions/oidc/#overview).
You'll need the base URL of your Open ID provider, and, in most cases, a client ID and secret.

These are referred to as `$ISSUER_URL`, `$CLIENT_ID`, and `$CLIENT_SECRET`.

## 2. Start endpoints for your services

Start an internal [Agent Endpoint](/universal-gateway/agent-endpoints/), replacing `$PORT` based on where one of your upstream services listen.
You can also use one of the [SDKs](/agent-sdks) or the [Kubernetes Operator](/k8s).

```bash
ngrok http $PORT --url https://service-one.internal
```

Start a second agent endpoint for another service you want to route to, replacing `$OTHER_PORT` with the port for this service.

```bash
ngrok http $OTHER_PORT --url https://service-two.internal
```

Repeat the process for as many services as you need to route to.

## 3. Reserve a domain

<ReserveDomain />

## 4. Create a Cloud Endpoint

<CloudEndpoint />

## 5. Enforce OIDC authentication and routing with Traffic Policy

While viewing your new cloud endpoint in the dashboard, copy the policy below and paste it into the Traffic Policy editor, replacing `$ISSUER_URL`, `$CLIENT_ID`, and `$CLIENT_SECRET` with the appropriate values.

```yaml
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: openid-connect
        config:
          issuer_url: "$ISSUER_URL"
          client_id: "$CLIENT_ID"
          client_secret: "$CLIENT_SECRET"
          scopes:
            - openid

  - expressions:
      - actions.ngrok.oidc.identity.name == 'Bob'
    actions:
      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: https://service-one.internal
  - expressions:

      - actions.ngrok.oidc.identity.name == 'Alice'
    actions:
      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: https://service-two.internal
```

**What's happening here?** This policy first requires OIDC authentication on every request using your issuer URL, client ID, and client secret.

If you authenticate successfully, this policy then filters your request based on the name as returned from your OIDC provider and routes your request to a specific service.

## 6. Try out your endpoints

<TryOut />
