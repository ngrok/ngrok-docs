[Odoo](https://www.odoo.com/) is an open-source ERP and business management suite that you can self-host for development, demos, or integrations.
When you need to share your instance over HTTPS or accept webhooks without deploying to the public internet, ngrok gives you a stable URL and powerful Traffic Policy controls to lock down access.

This guide follows the style of our [n8n example](/universal-gateway/examples/n8n/) and adds Odoo-specific steps, including using a static domain and applying a Traffic Policy.

## What you'll need

- An ngrok account.
- The ngrok Agent CLI installed.
- Odoo running locally (default: `http://localhost:8069`).
- (Recommended) Admin access in Odoo to change System Parameters.

## 1. Reserve a static domain

A static domain ensures your URL doesn't change across restarts (important for Odoo links, redirects, and webhooks).

In the ngrok dashboard, go to **Domains** → **New +**.
Reserve a domain (this example uses `https://your-odoo.ngrok.app`) and save it as an environment variable:

```bash
export NGROK_DOMAIN=your-odoo.ngrok.app
```

<Info>
	Why a static domain? Odoo stores and uses absolute links. A stable host
	prevents broken links in emails, reports, and third-party callbacks.
</Info>

## 2. Start the ngrok endpoint for Odoo

Expose Odoo on port `8069` at your static domain:

```bash
ngrok http --domain=$NGROK_DOMAIN 8069
```

Open `https://$NGROK_DOMAIN` to see the Odoo login page (`/web/login`).

## 3. (Recommended) Configure Odoo for a proxy and stable URLs

Make sure Odoo generates correct HTTPS links and doesn't rewrite your base URL.

### Enable proxy mode

If ngrok (or any reverse proxy) terminates TLS, enable Odoo's proxy mode:

```ini title="odoo.conf"
[options]
proxy_mode = True
```

Restart Odoo after changing the config.

### Freeze the base URL

Odoo updates `web.base.url` based on the host used at login. To keep it stable:

In Odoo, go to **Settings** → **Technical** → **System Parameters** (enable developer mode if needed).

Create or update:

- `web.base.url` → `https://$NGROK_DOMAIN`
- `web.base.url.freeze` → `True`

This prevents unexpected rewrites if someone visits via a different hostname.

## 4. Apply a Traffic Policy (secure your admin)

Protect sensitive paths like `/web` and `/web/login` using Traffic Policy.
Create a policy file (such as `odoo-policy.yaml`) and run the agent with `--traffic-policy-file`.

### Option A: Restrict admin to your IP

```yaml title="odoo-policy.yaml"
on_http_request:
  - if: request.path.startsWith("/web")
    actions:
      - type: restrict-ips
        config:
          # Replace with your public IP/CIDR, such as "203.0.113.7/32"
          allow: ["$YOUR_IP_CIDR"]
```

Run:

```bash
ngrok http --domain=$NGROK_DOMAIN 8069 \
  --traffic-policy-file odoo-policy.yaml
```

Only the allowed IPs can reach `/web*`; other requests are blocked before they hit Odoo.

### Option B: Require Basic Auth on admin

```yaml title="odoo-policy.yaml"
on_http_request:
  - if: request.path.startsWith("/web")
    actions:
      - type: basic-auth
        config:
          realm: "Odoo Admin"
          credentials:
            - "admin:changeMeNow123"
```

Run with the same `--traffic-policy-file` flag.
Visitors to `/web*` must pass HTTP Basic Auth before Odoo's own login.

<Tip>
	You can combine rules—for example, applying Basic Auth for `/web*` and
	providing unrestricted access for public website paths.
</Tip>

## 5. Test your endpoint

From a terminal:

```bash
curl -I https://$NGROK_DOMAIN
```

Expected: HTTP/2 200 and Odoo's login route (`/web/login`) when loaded in a browser.

## Troubleshooting

- **Blank or mixed-content pages**: Ensure `proxy_mode = True` and you're visiting `https://$NGROK_DOMAIN`.
- **Redirect loops or wrong links**: Verify `web.base.url` is exactly `https://$NGROK_DOMAIN` and `web.base.url.freeze = True`.
- **403 when applying policy**: Confirm your IP/CIDR is correct or disable the policy while debugging.
- **Port issues**: Odoo defaults to `8069`; double-check the port if customized.

## What's next?

- Layer additional [policies](/traffic-policy/) (OAuth/OIDC, rate limits, IP allow/deny lists) as needed.
- Use the ngrok dashboard's [Traffic Inspector](/obs/traffic-inspection/) to watch live requests and responses while testing.
- Reserve a custom domain you own and enable HTTPS via ngrok for a branded URL.
