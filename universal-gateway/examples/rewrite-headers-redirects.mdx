Many of our customers use ngrok for [site-to-site connectivity](/guides/site-to-site-connectivity/).
This is usually pretty straightforward, but occasionally a service requires a specific `Host` header or uses internal DNS names or redirect flows that break in an outbound tunneled environment (for example, `302` redirects to `internal.corp.local`).

With ngrok, you can use the [`url-rewrite` action](/traffic-policy/actions/url-rewrite) in a traffic policy to intercept `302` redirect headers coming from customer apps to preserve UX and agent behavior.

## 1. Create an endpoint for the customer's upstream service

Start an internal [Agent Endpoint](/universal-gateway/agent-endpoints/), replacing `$PORT` based on where the upstream service listens and using a URL namespacing scheme that logically separates individual services and customers.
You can also use one of our [SDKs](/agent-sdks) or the [Kubernetes Operator](/k8s).

Depending on how you work with your customer, you may be creating this endpoint or instructing them how to do it themselves.

```bash
ngrok http $PORT --url https://service-01.customer-abc.internal
```

## 2. Reserve a domain

<ReserveDomain domain="https://service-01.customer-abc.ngrok.app" />

## 3. Create a Cloud Endpoint

<CloudEndpoint />

## 4. Use Traffic Policy to route traffic and edit headers

While still viewing your new cloud endpoint in the dashboard, copy and paste the policy below into the Traffic Policy editor, then replace `$NGROK_DOMAIN`.

```yaml
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: add-headers
        config:
          headers:
            host: 127.0.0.1
      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: https://service-01.customer-abc.internal

on_http_response:
  - expressions:
      - "res.status_code == 302"
    actions:
      - type: set-vars
        config:
          vars:
            orig: "${url.parse(res.location).path}"
      - type: remove-headers
        config:
          headers:
            - Location
      - type: add-headers
        config:
          headers:
            Location: "$NGROK_DOMAIN/${vars.orig}"
```

**What's happening here?** First, this policy rewrites the `Host` header on all requests to `127.0.0.1` so that your customer's upstream service recognizes the request as coming from the same local network, not through ngrok, then forwards the request to the internal Agent Endpoint you created in the first step.

During the HTTP response, the policy then checks whether the status code is `302`, which indicates content has moved.
If the status code is `302`, then the policy saves the existing path to a variable, removes the `Location` header, and writes a new `Location` header by building a new URL based on `$NGROK_URL` and the original path.

- Follow along with our [comprehensive site-to-site guide](/guides/site-to-site-connectivity/) for ways to make your setup more production-ready, like creating service users to isolate agents and white-labeling ngrok with a custom connect URL.
- Read more about [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy), [core concepts](/traffic-policy/concepts), and [actions](/traffic-policy/actions) you might want to implement next.
