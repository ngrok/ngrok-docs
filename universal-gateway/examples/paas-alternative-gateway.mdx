A self-hosted PaaS alternative gateway provides the developer experience and features of managed platforms without surrendering control of your infrastructure.
It handles TLS termination, custom domains, load balancing, authentication, observability, and securityâ€”perfect for teams migrating from Heroku or Vercel while keeping the operational polish.

With this setup, you can:

- Load balance across multiple app instances with automatic failover
- Terminate TLS and use custom domains professionally
- Add authentication and security without changing your application code
- Monitor traffic and performance with comprehensive logging
- Protect against attacks with WAF-like rules and rate limiting
- Handle geo-aware routing and DDoS protection at the edge

## 1. Create endpoints for your application instances

Start multiple [Agent Endpoints](/universal-gateway/agent-endpoints/) with the same URL to create an endpoint pool for automatic load balancing. Replace `$PORT` with your application ports.
You can also use one of our [SDKs](/agent-sdks) or the [Kubernetes Operator](/k8s).

If you only have one instance now, you can add additional replicas later for redundancy through load balancing.

```bash
# Instance 1
ngrok http $PORT --url https://service.internal --pooling-enabled

# Instance 2 (optional)
ngrok http $PORT --url https://service.internal --pooling-enabled

# Instance 3 (optional)
ngrok http $PORT --url https://service.internal --pooling-enabled
```

<Tip>
By using the same URL with `--pooling-enabled`, ngrok automatically creates an [Endpoint Pool](/universal-gateway/endpoint-pooling) that distributes traffic round-robin across all healthy instances with automatic failover.
</Tip>

## 2. Reserve a domain

<ReserveDomain />

<Tip>
For a production PaaS alternative, consider using a [custom domain](/universal-gateway/custom-domains/) you own instead of an ngrok subdomain.
</Tip>

## 3. Create a Cloud Endpoint

<CloudEndpoint />

## 4. Create a vault and secrets

Store your authentication and API secrets securely using [Traffic Policy Secrets](/traffic-policy/secrets).

First, create a vault to store your application secrets:

```bash
ngrok api vaults create --name "paas-gateway" --description "PaaS gateway authentication and API secrets"
```

Then add your secrets using the vault ID from the response:

```bash
# OAuth client secret for app authentication
ngrok api secrets create \
  --name "oauth-client-secret" \
  --value "your_oauth_client_secret_here" \
  --vault-id "$VAULT_ID"

# API key for admin access
ngrok api secrets create \
  --name "admin-api-key" \
  --value "your_admin_api_key_here" \
  --vault-id "$VAULT_ID"
```

## 5. Apply Traffic Policy to your Cloud Endpoint

While viewing your new cloud endpoint in the dashboard, copy the policy below and paste it into the Traffic Policy editor.
Make sure you change each of the following values:

- `$GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`: Replace with your GitHub OAuth app client ID
- `$YOUR_ADMIN_EMAIL`: Replace with your admin email address for OAuth access
- `$YOUR_ADMIN_USERNAME`: Replace with the username for API authentication
- `https://service.internal`: Replace with your actual pooled endpoint URL

```yaml
on_http_request:
  # WAF-like protection using OWASP CRS
  - actions:
      - type: owasp-crs-request
        config:
          on_error: halt

  # Rate limiting for DDoS protection

    actions:

  # Admin authentication for /admin paths

    actions:

    actions:

        config:
          status_code: 403
          headers:
            content-type: "text/plain"
          body: "Access denied. Contact your administrator."

  # API authentication for /api paths

    actions:
      - type: basic-auth
        config:

          realm: "API Access"

  # Forward to your application pool (automatic load balancing)
  - actions:
      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: https://service.internal

on_http_response:
  # OWASP protection for responses
  - actions:
      - type: owasp-crs-response
        config:
          on_error: halt

  # Add security headers (based on OWASP recommendations)
  - actions:
      - type: add-headers
        config:
          headers:
            # Prevent clickjacking attacks
            x-frame-options: "DENY"
            # Prevent MIME-sniffing
            x-content-type-options: "nosniff"
            # Control referrer information
            referrer-policy: "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
            # Enforce HTTPS (adjust max-age as needed)
            strict-transport-security: "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"
            # Cross-origin isolation (modern browsers)
            cross-origin-opener-policy: "same-origin"
```

**What's happening here?**
This policy creates a production-ready PaaS alternative.
On every HTTP request, the policy enforces OWASP WAF protection, DDoS mitigation via rate limiting, bot blocking for unwanted crawlers and Tor traffic, and authentication for admin/API routes, before forwarding your request to the pool of upstream services.

On every HTTP response, the policy enforces WAF rules on the headers and body, then adds [common security headers](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/HTTP_Headers_Cheat_Sheet.html) to the response.

## 6. Try out your endpoint

<TryOut />

Test a few of the features you added with Traffic Policy:

```bash
# Test WAF with a potentially malicious request
curl https://$NGROK_DOMAIN/files?name=../../../../etc/passwd"

# Test admin authentication (will redirect to OAuth)
curl "https://$NGROK_DOMAIN/admin/dashboard"

# Test API authentication (basic auth with base64 encoded credentials)
# First, base64 encode the $YOUR_ADMIN_USERNAME:your_admin_api_key_here pair
# Example: admin:secret-api-key becomes YWRtaW46c2VjcmV0LWFwaS1rZXk=
curl -H "Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46c2VjcmV0LWFwaS1rZXk=" \
     "https://$NGROK_DOMAIN/api/stats"

# Test bot blocking (should get 404)
curl -H "User-Agent: GPTBot" \
     "https://$NGROK_DOMAIN/"
```
