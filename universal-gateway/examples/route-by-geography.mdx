To route traffic to specific regions, you can use ngrokâ€™s Cloud Endpoints, internal Agent Endpoints, and Traffic Policy engine to match incoming traffic based on the [client's IP geolocation data](/traffic-policy/variables/connection/#conngeocountry-code) using [ISO 3166 country codes](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html), then forward requests to the appropriate regional endpoints.

With this setup, you can:

- Showcase user content tailored to their region, like country-specific pricing.
- Comply with regulations like GDPR.
- Ensure your customers' traffic is routed to the nearest possible endpoint for the best latency.

This also implements the ['front door' pattern](/universal-gateway/examples/front-door-pattern), which creates a loose coupling between the traffic management logic at your gateway and your services.

## 1. Start endpoints for your services

On a server designated for US traffic, start an internal [Agent Endpoint](/universal-gateway/agent-endpoints/), replacing `$PORT` based on where your service listens.
You can also use one of our [SDKs](/agent-sdks) or the [Kubernetes Operator](/k8s).

```bash
ngrok http $PORT --url https://us-service.internal
```

On a server designated for Canadian traffic, start a second endpoint.

```bash
ngrok http $PORT --url https://ca-service.internal
```

## 2. Reserve a domain

<ReserveDomain />

## 3. Create a Cloud Endpoint

<CloudEndpoint />

## 4. Add routing to your services with Traffic Policy

While viewing your new cloud endpoint in the dashboard, copy the policy below and paste it into the Traffic Policy editor.

```yaml
on_http_request:
  - expressions:
      # Check if the client is from the US
      - "conn.geo.country_code == 'US'"
    actions:
      # Forward the request to the US internal service
      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: http://us-service.internal

  - expressions:
      # Check if the client is from Canada
      - "conn.geo.country_code == 'CA'"
    actions:
      # Forward the request to the CA internal service
      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: http://ca-service.internal

  - actions:
      # Forward all other requests to a "default" service of your choosing
      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: http://us-service.internal
```

**What's happening here?** This policy checks checks every HTTP request for where it originated from.
If that's the US or Canada, ngrok forwards the traffic to its respective endpoint.
If the traffic comes from any other country, ngrok forwards it to a "default" service of your choosing.

## 5. Try out your endpoint

<TryOut />
