description: Learn about ngrok's Traffic Policy configuration language for filtering, matching, managing, and orchestrating endpoint traffic.
---

ngrok's Traffic Policy is a configuration language that offers you the flexibility to filter, match, manage, and orchestrate traffic to your endpoints.

- alidate incoming traffic, block malicious traffic, rewrite URLs, and respond with custom content.
- Forward traffic to your agents running across the globe and orchestrate traffic across your infrastructure.
- Add Traffic Policies to any type of ngrok endpoint to scope traffic management for each of your endpoints.

## Concepts

<Columns cols={1}>
	<Card title="Phases" href="/traffic-policy/concepts/phases" horizontal>
		Defined points in the traffic lifecycle where you can apply logic.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Phase Rules" href="/traffic-policy/concepts/phase-rules" horizontal>
		The set of conditions and actions applied during specific phases to filter,
		manipulate, or manage traffic.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Expressions" href="/traffic-policy/concepts/expressions" horizontal>
		Conditions used in Phase Rules to determine when an action should be applied.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Actions" href="/traffic-policy/concepts/actions" horizontal>
		Logic that is triggered when a Phase Rule condition is met.
	</Card>
	<Card title="CEL Interpolation" href="/traffic-policy/concepts/cel-interpolation" horizontal>
		A way to dynamically evaluate variables and macros inside configuration values,

## Features

- [Actions](/traffic-policy/actions/) - Transform, redirect, and manage traffic flow with actions like `add-headers`, `rate-limit`, and `jwt-validation`.
- [Variables](/traffic-policy/variables/) - Filter, segment, and dynamically configure traffic rules and actions based on specific conditions.
- [Macros](/traffic-policy/macros/) - Apply macros in rule conditions to refine traffic segmentation and configure actions with dynamic precision.
