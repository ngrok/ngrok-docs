description: Learn about ngrok's Traffic Policy for configuring traffic management on endpoints, including authentication, rate limiting, URL rewriting, and more.
---

ngrok's Traffic Policy is a configuration language that offers you the flexibility to filter, match, manage, and orchestrate traffic to your endpoints.

- Validate incoming traffic, block malicious traffic, rewrite URLs, and respond with custom content.
- Forward traffic to your agents running across the globe and orchestrate traffic across your infrastructure.
- Scope traffic management for any kind of ngrok endpoint.

## Features

- [Actions](/traffic-policy/how-it-works#actions) - Transform, redirect, and manage traffic flow with actions like `add-headers`, `rate-limit`, and `jwt-validation`.
- [Variables](/traffic-policy/variables/) - Predefined values representing things like the IP address associated with a request, the URL of the endpoint accepting the traffic, and more, which can be used to dynamically manage traffic.
- [Macros](/traffic-policy/macros/) - Apply macros in rule conditions to refine traffic segmentation and configure actions with dynamic precision.
