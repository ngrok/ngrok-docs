description: Learn about ngrok's Traffic Policy for authenticating requests, rate limiting traffic, rewriting URLs, and applying security controls.
---


ngrok's Traffic Policy is a configuration language that offers you the flexibility to filter, match, manage, and orchestrate traffic to your endpoints.

- Validate incoming traffic, block malicious traffic, rewrite URLs, and respond with custom content.
- Forward traffic to your agents running across the globe and orchestrate traffic across your infrastructure.
- Add Traffic Policies to any type of ngrok endpoint to scope traffic management for each of your endpoints.

## Concepts

<Columns cols={1}>
  <Card title="Phases" href="/traffic-policy/concepts/phases" horizontal>
    Defined points in the lifecycle of a request to your endpoint where you can use Traffic Policy to modify request headers, transform response bodies, and more.
</Card>
  <Card title="Phase Rules" href="/traffic-policy/concepts/phase-rules" horizontal>
    {" "}
    Conditions and actions you configure to filter, manipulate, or manage traffic at specific phases, such as blocking requests from certain IPs or adding authentication headers.
</Card>
  <Card title="Expressions" href="/traffic-policy/concepts/expressions" horizontal>
    {" "}
    Conditions used in Phase Rules to determine when an action should be applied, such as checking if a request header matches a value or if an IP address is in a blocklist.
</Card>
  <Card title="Actions" href="/traffic-policy/concepts/actions" horizontal>
    Operations that execute when a Phase Rule condition is met, such as adding headers, rate limiting requests, or redirecting traffic.
</Card>
  <Card title="CEL Interpolation" href="/traffic-policy/concepts/cel-interpolation" horizontal>
    {" "}
    Dynamically evaluate variables and macros in configuration values, such as inserting request headers into URLs or using timestamps in response headers.
</Card>
</Columns>

## Features

- [Actions](/traffic-policy/actions/) - Transform, redirect, and manage traffic flow with actions like `add-headers`, `rate-limit`, and `jwt-validation`.
- [Variables](/traffic-policy/variables/) - Filter, segment, and dynamically configure traffic rules and actions based on specific conditions.
- [Macros](/traffic-policy/macros/) - Apply macros in rule conditions to refine traffic segmentation and configure actions with dynamic precision.

## Use cases

</Card>
  <Card title="Add authentication" icon="key" href="/traffic-policy/examples/add-authentication/">
    {" "}
    Add JWT validation, OAuth, OIDC, and basic authentication to secure your endpoints.
</Card>
  <Card title="Rate limit requests" icon="gauge" href="/traffic-policy/examples/rate-limit-requests/">
    {" "}
    Rate limit requests based on endpoint, IP address, or API key to protect your services.
</Card>
  <Card title="Rewrite URLs" icon="pencil" href="/traffic-policy/examples/url-rewrites/">
    {" "}
