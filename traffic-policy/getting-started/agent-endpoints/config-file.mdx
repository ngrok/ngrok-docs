---

The following getting started guide will take you through starting an Agent Endpoint with a Traffic Policy applied via the [Agent Configuration File](/agent/config/). Note, this guide requires that your agent configuration file is set to [v3](/agent/config/v3).

## What you'll need

- An [ngrok account](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/).
- The [ngrok Agent CLI](https://ngrok.com/download) installed.

## 1. Edit your ngrok configuration file

Enter the following command into your terminal:

```bash
ngrok config edit
```

In your configuration file, add the following content to the bottom and save the file:

```yaml
endpoints:
  - name: my-agent-endpoint
    description: My first Agent Endpoint with a Traffic Policy
    upstream:
      url: 80
    traffic_policy:
      on_http_request:
        - actions:
            - type: custom-response
              config:
                status_code: 200
                body: Hello, World!
```

This policy will respond to each HTTP request with “Hello, World!"

<Note>

Your configuration file `version` must be set to `3`.

</Note>

## 2. Start your Agent Endpoint

Start your Agent Endpoint by running the following command:

```bash
ngrok start my-agent-endpoint
```

This command will start an HTTP tunnel for port `80`, using the specified Traffic Policy in the config file to manage traffic.

## 3. Test it out

After running the ngrok command in the previous step you should now see a URL in the forwarding section. Open the URL in your web browser. You should see the "Hello, World!" message displayed in your browser.

## What's next?

You've now successfully set up your first Agent Endpoint with a custom Traffic Policy using the ngrok agent configuration file.
