The ngrok Traffic Policy engine enables you to manage traffic consistently across your endpoints. It allows you to inspect, manipulate, and route traffic in a structured way.

Traffic Policy is composed of a few key components:

- [**Phases:**](./concepts/phases) Defined points in the traffic lifecycle where you can apply logic.
- [**Phase Rules:**](./concepts/phase-rules) The set of conditions and actions applied during specific phases to filter, manipulate, or manage traffic.
- [**Expressions:**](./concepts/expressions) Conditions used in Phase Rules to determine when an action should be applied.
- [**Actions:**](./concepts/actions) Logic that is triggered when a Phase Rule condition is met.
- [**CEL Interpolation:**](./concepts/cel-interpolation) A way to dynamically evaluate variables and macros inside configuration values, such as URLs or headers.

By combining these components, Traffic Policy provides a powerful way to control your traffic flow at a fine-grained level.
