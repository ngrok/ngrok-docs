description: Learn how to write CEL expressions in Traffic Policy to define conditions for triggering actions based on traffic attributes.
---


Expressions are a powerful way to define the conditions under which specific actions in a [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/concepts/phase-rules) are triggered.
Expressions are written in the [Common Expression Language (CEL)](https://github.com/google/cel-spec) and allow you to evaluate various traffic attributes, such as headers, paths, IP addresses, and more.

Each expression must evaluate to `true` for the corresponding actions in a rule to be executed.
If a rule contains no expressions, it will always evaluate to `true`, causing its actions to be applied to all matching traffic.

## Available elements

Expressions in Traffic Policies can reference a variety of elements, including:

- **[Traffic Policy Variables](/traffic-policy/variables)**: These allow you to access metadata about the connection or request, such as certificate details, headers, client IP, geo-location and more.
- **[Traffic Policy Macros](/traffic-policy/macros)**: Macros simplify complex conditions, enabling reusable patterns across expressions and policies.
- **[Action Variables](/traffic-policy/actions)**: Some actions may provide additional variables, enabling deeper customization based on specific action outcomes.

## Use cases

Expressions give you the flexibility to:

- **Filter traffic**: Evaluate headers, IP addresses, or other attributes to decide if traffic should match a given rule.
- **Route traffic**: Forward traffic based on factors such as geolocation, protocol, or path.
- **Control flow**: Implement more complex routing decisions based on dynamic conditions, ensuring optimal traffic handling.

## Common examples

### Match based on header

```yaml
expressions:
  - req.headers["authorization"][0] == "Bearer my-token"
```

### Match requests to a specific path

```yaml
expressions:
  - req.url.path.startsWith("/api/v1/")
```

### Match by country

```yaml
expressions:
  - conn.client_ip.geo.location.country_code == "US"
```

## Writing expressions

### Basic syntax

Expressions are written in CEL and are similar to expressions in languages like C, JavaScript, or Python.
They can include variables, literals, and operators.

### Variables

Variables refer to values.
For example, `identity` might refer to a user object.

```yaml
expressions:
  - identity.age >= 18 // Checks if the user's age is 18 or more.
```

### Literals

CEL supports several literal types:

- **Boolean**: `true`, `false`
- **Integer**: `42`, `-7`
- **String**: `"hello"`, `'world'`
- **List**: `[1, 2, 3]`
- **Map**: `{"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}`

### Operators

CEL provides a rich set of operators for arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations:

- **Arithmetic**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- **Comparison**: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`
- **Logical**: `&&`, `||`, `!`

<Warning>
You must wrap expressions containing `!` in quotes for them to be parsed correctly.

❌ This expression does not work:

```yaml
on_tcp_connect:
  - expressions:
      - !(conn.client_ip in ['2001:4860:7:f0e::f4', '98.35.32.113'])
    actions:
      - type: deny
```

✅ Wrapping the expression in quotes ensures that it'll be parsed correctly:

```yaml
on_tcp_connect:
  - expressions:
      - "!(conn.client_ip in ['2001:4860:7:f0e::f4', '98.35.32.113'])"
    actions:
      - type: deny
```

</Warning>

#### Using arithmetic

```go
5 * (3 - 1) // Evaluates to 10
```

#### Using comparison and logical operators

```go
// Checks if the user is 18 or older and is in the U.S.
identity.age >= 18 && identity.country == "US"
```

### Strings

#### String concatenation

To combine strings, use the `+` Operator:

```go
"Hello, " + "world!" // Results in "Hello, world!"
```

#### String functions

CEL provides several built-in functions to work with strings, enabling you to perform transformations, query information, or compare strings.

##### `size()`

Returns the number of characters in the string:

```go
size("Hello") // Evaluates to 5
```

##### `startsWith()`

Checks if the string starts with a specified substring:

```go
"Hello, world".startsWith("Hello") // Evaluates to true
```

##### `endsWith()`

Checks if the string ends with a specified substring:

```go
"Hello, world".endsWith("world") // Evaluates to true
```

##### `matches()`

Determines if the string matches a regular expression pattern:

```go
"Hello, world".matches("H.*d") // Evaluates to true
```

##### `contains()`

To check if a string contains another string:

```go
"Hello, world!".contains("world") // Evaluates to true
```

#### Advanced string manipulation

##### Regular expressions

CEL's `matches()` function allows you to use regular expressions for pattern matching.
This can be powerful for validation or extracting parts of strings:

```go
// Evaluates to true for a valid email format
"user@example.com".matches("^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$")
```

##### Concatenation and Interpolation

While direct string interpolation isn't a feature in CEL, concatenation can be used to dynamically construct strings:

```go
// Interpolates number to string
"Your order number is: " + string(order_number)
```

##### Working with Unicode

Strings in CEL are Unicode and can handle a wide range of characters:

```go
// Evaluates to 5, as there are 5 characters in this Japanese greeting
size("こんにちは")
```

##### String comparison

String comparison in CEL is case-sensitive and uses the standard comparison operators:

```go
"apple" == "Apple" // Evaluates to false due to case difference
"apple" < "banana" // Alphabetically compares strings, evaluates to true
```

### Lists

A list in CEL is an ordered collection of elements.
You can perform various operations on lists, including checking if an item is contained within a list, accessing elements by their index, and iterating over elements.

#### Creating a list

```go
var my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

#### Checking for Membership

To check if a value exists in a list, use the `in` Operator:

```go
2 in my_list; // Evaluates to true
5 in my_list; // Evaluates to false
```

#### Accessing elements

Access elements by their index (0-based):

```go
// Accesses the second element, evaluates to 2
my_list[1];
```

#### Counting elements

Returns the number of elements in the list:

```go
size(my_list) // Evaluates to 4
```

#### Iterating over a list

Use a comprehension to iterate over elements in a list and apply logic:

```go
// Doubles each value in the list, resulting in [2, 4, 6, 8]
[value * 2 for value in my_list]
```

#### Filtering a list

Filter a list to include only certain elements:

```go
// Keeps only values greater than 2, resulting in [3, 4]
[value for value in my_list if value > 2]
```

#### Membership in lists

The `in` Operator is versatile and can be used to check for membership in both lists:

```go
// For maps (checks keys)
"apple" in { apple: 1, banana: 2 } // true
```

### Maps

A map in CEL is a collection of key-value pairs.
Keys are unique, and each key maps to exactly one value.
You can check for the presence of keys, access values by their keys, and iterate over keys or values.

#### Creating a map

```go
var my_map = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }
```

#### Checking for key presence

To check if a key is present in a map, use the `in` Operator:

```go
"a" in my_map; // Evaluates to true
"d" in my_map; // Evaluates to false
```

#### Accessing values

Access values by their keys:

```go
// Accesses the value for the key "a", evaluates to 1
my_map["a"]
```

#### Counting elements

Returns the number of key-value pairs present in the map:

```go
size(my_map) // Evaluates to 3
```

#### Iterating over a map

You can iterate over the keys or values of a map using a comprehension:

```go
// Extracts all keys, resulting in ["a", "b", "c"]
[key for key, value in my_map]

// Extracts all values, resulting in [1, 2, 3]
[value for key, value in my_map]
```

#### Checking for a Condition in a Map

Use `exists` or `all` macros to check if any or all elements in a collection meet a condition:

```go
// Checks if any key in the map starts with "a"
my_map.exists(key, key.startsWith("a")) // Evaluates to true

// Checks if all values in the map are greater than 0
my_map.all(value, value > 0) // Evaluates to true
```

#### Membership in maps

The `in` Operator is versatile and can be used to check for membership in maps:

```go
// For maps (checks keys)
"apple" in { apple: 1, banana: 2 } // true
```
