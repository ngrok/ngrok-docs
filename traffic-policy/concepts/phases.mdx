In Traffic Policy, a phase represents a distinct point in the lifecycle of a request as it moves through an ngrok endpoint. Phases allow you to inspect, process, and manage traffic at key moments.

## Traffic Policy phases

### `on_tcp_connect`

The first phase in the traffic lifecycle. This phase is triggered when a new TCP connection is established. It provides an opportunity to allow, reject, or manipulate connections before any higher-level protocol processing begins. This phase is present in all traffic to the endpoint.

### `on_http_request`

Activated when ngrok receives an HTTP request over an established connection. This phase provides access to the request's details (for example, headers, method, path) as variables and is ideal for actions like forwarding traffic, rewriting paths, or applying authentication and rate limits.

### `on_http_response`

Triggered after ngrok receives a response from the upstream service. This phase allows you to modify the response before it is sent to the client, such as by adding headers, changing status codes, or transforming the response body.

## Phases available by protocol

Some phases are not available on certain protocols. The following table defines the availability by protocol:

| Protocol  | on_tcp_connect | on_http_request | on_http_response |
| --------- | -------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| **HTTPS** | ✅             | ✅              | ✅               |
| **HTTP**  | ✅             | ✅              | ✅               |
| **TLS**   | ✅             | ❌              | ❌               |
| **TCP**   | ✅             | ❌              | ❌               |

## Phase Rules

Each Phase is made up of Phase Rules. Phase Rules allow you to define how traffic is filtered and processed within a phase. To do this each rule consists of two key parts: **expressions** and **actions**.

Here is an example:

```yaml
on_tcp_connect:
  - expressions:
      - conn.client_ip == '192.168.1.200'
    actions:
      - type: deny
```

### Expressions

Expressions are conditions written in [Common Expression Language (CEL)](https://github.com/google/cel-spec) that can be used to evaluate specific traffic attributes, such as the client IP, request URL, or HTTP method. These conditions determine whether a rule applies to a given traffic flow. For instance, an expression like `conn.client_ip == '192.168.1.200'` targets requests from a specific IP address.

You can define multiple expressions, which are automatically combined using the `&&` Operator. This means all expressions in the list must evaluate to `true` for the associated rules to run. If no expressions are provided, the system defaults to `true`, ensuring the rule matches all traffic, and the specified actions are executed in sequence.

By combining multiple conditions, you can craft highly specific and flexible rules to manage traffic effectively.

### Actions

Actions define the behavior that is applied when the expressions evaluate to true. Each action specifies a particular operation to be applied, such as denying traffic, modifying headers, or redirecting requests. Actions are executed sequentially as defined in the policy, but note that some actions can short-circuit the request and return without executing subsequent actions.

For example, the following action denies traffic and returns a `404` HTTP status code:

```yaml
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: "deny"
        config:
          status_code: 404
```

For a full list of actions, check out the [Action Hub](../actions).

### Chaining rules and priority

Multiple rules can be defined within a single phase. Rules are evaluated in the order they are defined, and their execution depends on the type of actions taken. For example:

- Some actions (for example, `deny`) immediately stop further rule evaluation.
- Others (for example, `url-rewrite`) allow subsequent rules to apply.

This flexibility enables layered and powerful Traffic Policies.
