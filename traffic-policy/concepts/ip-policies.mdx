IP Policies are reusable groups of rules for allowing or denying traffic and ngrok dashboard access from specific IPs and CIDRs.
You can enforce them in the following scenarios:

## Applying IP Policies to Endpoints

You can add an IP Policy to your endpoints using the [`restrict-ips`](/traffic-policy/actions/restrict-ips) Traffic Policy Action.

To get started with an Agent Endpoint, create a `policy.yml` or `policy.json` file on the same machine as the endpoint.
To use a Cloud Endpoint, [visit the Endpoints section in the ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/endpoints) and select the Cloud Endpoint.
You'll be taken to the Traffic Policy editor.

The contents of the policy file should be the following:

<CodeGroup>
  ```yaml policy.yml
  on_http_request:
  # Only allow requests from trusted IPs
  - actions:
  - type: restrict-ips
        config:
          allow:
  - 203.0.113.0/24
  - 198.51.100.42/32
  ```

```json policy.json
{
  "on_http_request": [
    {
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "restrict-ips",
          "config": {
            "allow": ["203.0.113.0/24", "198.51.100.42/32"]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
</CodeGroup>

If you're using a Cloud Endpoint, save your changes in the dashboard.
To apply this policy to your Agent Endpoint, start it using the `--traffic-policy-file` flag as shown in the following example:

```bash
ngrok http $YOUR_PORT --url $YOUR_DOMAIN --traffic-policy-file /path/to/policy.yml
```

## Applying account-wide IP Policies

To apply account-wide IP Policies, you can use [the IP Restrictions feature in the ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/ip-restrictions).

In the dashboard UI, you can apply [IP Restrictions](/traffic-policy/examples/add-authentication#ip-restrictions) to users trying to sign in to your ngrok dashboard, traffic trying to access your API or Endpoints, and source IPs trying to start Agent Endpoints on your account.

You can define the IP Policies that make up your restrictions in the dashboard UI.
