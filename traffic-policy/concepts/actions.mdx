## Non-terminating Actions

Some Actions can short-circuit a request and immediately return a response. These are called **terminating Actions**. **Non-terminating Actions** do not return a response, but instead go to the next Action in the chain. All **Cloud Endpoint** Traffic Policies must end with a terminating Action. This requirement does not apply to **Agent Endpoints**.


The list of terminating Traffic Policy Actions includes:
- [`close-connection`](/traffic-policy/actions/close-connection)
- [`custom-response`](/traffic-policy/actions/custom-response)
- [`deny`](/traffic-policy/actions/deny)
