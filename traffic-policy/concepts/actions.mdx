## Non-terminating Actions

Some Actions can short-circuit a request and immediately return a response. These are called **terminating Actions**. **Non-terminating Actions** do not return a response, but instead go to the next Action in the chain. All Traffic Policies must end with a terminating Action.

The list of terminating Traffic Policy Actions includes:
- [close_connection](/traffic-policy/actions/close-connection)
- [custom_response](/traffic-policy/actions/custom-response)
- [deny](/traffic-policy/actions/deny)
- [forward_external](/traffic-policy/actions/forward-external)
- [forward_labels](/traffic-policy/actions/forward-labels)
