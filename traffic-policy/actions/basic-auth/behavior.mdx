### Behavior

The **basic-auth** action enforces HTTP Basic Authentication on incoming requests, as specified
in [RFC 7235](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7235). When a request is received, the action
verifies the request by validating against a known set of `user:password` credentials. If the
verification is successful, the action allows the request to continue through the action chain and
finally to your application; if verification fails, the request will be terminated with a
`401 Unauthorized` response.

#### Additional Restrictions

You can specify only a limited number of `username:password` pairs. The password must be at least
8 characters and no more than 128 characters. Including multiple colons in the `username:password`
pair will result in the first colon being treated as the delimiter between the username and password.
Realm cannot exceed 128 characters, and cannot contain non-ASCII characters.

#### Verification Process

- **HTTP Authentication**: The action validates incoming HTTP requests to confirm they contain the required `Authorization` header, in the form of `Authorization: Basic <credentials>`, where `<credentials>` is the Base64 encoding of username and password joined by a single colon `:`.
- **Request Handling**: If the authentication is successful, the request is forwarded to the next action. If the authentication fails, it will return to user a `401` response, which will prompt the user to provide a correct set of credentials.
- **Configurable Enforcement**: By default, authentication failures result in 401s. However, setting `enforce: false` allows unauthenticated requests to proceed, while logging the authentication result. This option is for debugging and testing.

#### Secret Handling and Encryption

All secrets used for basic authentication are encrypted at config validation. When ngrok processes a request, the secret is decrypted.
