### Behavior

The **basic-auth** action requires incoming HTTP requests to successfully authenticate
with HTTP Basic Authentication as per RFC 7235. When a request is received, the action verifies 
the request by validating against a known set of `user:password` credentials. If the verification 
is successful, the action allows the request to continue through the action chain and to finally 
to your application; if verification fails, the request will be terminated with a 
`401 Unauthorized` response.

#### Additional Restrictions

You can specify only a limited number of `username:password` pairs. The password must be at least
8 characters and no more than 128 characters. The username can neither be be empty, nor can it exceed 
128 characters. Including multiple colons in the `username:password` pair will result in the first 
colon being treated as the delimiter between the username and password. Realm cannot exceed 128 
characters, and cannot contain non-ASCII characters.

#### Verification Process

- **HTTP Authentication**: The action validates incoming HTTP requests to confirm they contain the required `Authorization` header, in the form of `Authorization: Basic <credentials>`, where `<credentials>` is the Base64 encoding of ID and password joined by a single colon `:`.
- **Request Handling**: If the webhook authentication is successful, the request is forwarded to the next action. If the authentication fails, it will return to user a `401` response, which will prompt the user to provide a correct set of credentials.
- **Configurable Enforcement**: By default, authentication failures result in 401s. However, setting `enforce: false` allows unauthenticated requests to proceed, while logging the authentication result. This option is for debugging and testing.

#### Secret Handling and Encryption

All secrets used for webhook verification are encrypted at config validation. When ngrok processes a request, the secret is decrypted.
