The **Basic Auth** Traffic Policy action enables you to enforce HTTP Basic Auth
on your endpoints. Requests with a valid username and password will be sent to
your upstream service, all others will be rejected with a `401 Unauthorized` response.

### Configuration Reference

This is the [Traffic Policy](/docs/traffic-policy/) configuration
reference for this action.

#### Supported Phases

`on_http_request`

#### Type

`basic-auth`

#### Configuration Fields

<Config>
    <ConfigItem title="credentials" type="array of strings" required={true}>
        <p>A list of up to 10 allowed <code>username:password</code> credential pairs.</p>
        <p>Password must be at least <code>8</code> characters and no more than <code>128</code> characters.</p>
    </ConfigItem>

    <ConfigItem title="realm" type="string" required={false}>
        <p>The HTTP realm of the request as per <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7235">RFC 7235</a>.</p>
        <p>Default is <code>ngrok</code>.</p>
    </ConfigItem>

    <ConfigItem title="enforce" type="bool" required={false}>
        <p>Default <code>true</code>. If <code>false</code>, continue to the next action even if basic authentication failed. This is useful for handling fall-through, debugging, and testing purposes.</p>
    </ConfigItem>

</Config>

### Behavior

The **basic-auth** action enforces HTTP Basic Authentication on incoming requests, as specified
in [RFC 7235](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7235). When a request is received, the action
verifies the request by validating against a known set of `user:password` credentials. If the
verification is successful, the action allows the request to continue through the action chain and
finally to your application; if verification fails, the request will be terminated with a
`401 Unauthorized` response.

#### Additional Restrictions

You can specify up to 10 `username:password` pairs. The password must be at least
8 characters and no more than 128 characters. Including multiple colons in the `username:password`
pair will result in the first colon being treated as the delimiter between the username and password.
Realm cannot exceed 128 characters, and cannot contain non-ASCII characters.

#### Verification Process

- **HTTP Authentication**: The action validates incoming HTTP requests to confirm they contain the required `Authorization` header, in the form of `Authorization: Basic <credentials>`, where `<credentials>` is the Base64 encoding of username and password joined by a single colon `:`.
- **Request Handling**: If the authentication is successful, the request is forwarded to the next action. If the authentication fails, it will return to user a `401` response, which will prompt the user to provide a correct set of credentials.
- **Configurable Enforcement**: By default, authentication failures result in 401s. However, setting `enforce: false` allows unauthenticated requests to proceed, while logging the authentication result. This option is for debugging and testing.

#### Secret Handling and Encryption

All secrets used for basic authentication are encrypted at config validation. When ngrok processes a request, the secret is decrypted.

### Examples

The following [Traffic Policy](/docs/traffic-policy/)
configuration is an example configuration of the `basic-auth` action.

#### Example Traffic Policy Document

<ConfigExample
	snippetText={null}
	showLineNumbers={true}
	jsonMetastring="{5-51}"
	yamlMetastring="{4-28}"
	config={{
		on_http_request: [
			{
				actions: [
					{
						type: "basic-auth",
						config: {
							realm: "sample-realm",
							credentials: ["user:password1", "admin:password2"],
							enforce: true,
						},
					},
					{
						type: "custom-response",
						config: {
							status_code: 200,
							headers: { "content-type": "text/plain" },
							body: "Successfully Authenticated!",
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>

#### Example Request

First, base64 encode the `username:password` pair.
`user:password1` becomes `dXNlcjpwYXNzd29yZDE=`

```shell
$ curl --request GET \
  --url http://example-api.ngrok.app/ \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic dXNlcjpwYXNzd29yZDE=`'
```

```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
content-type: text/html
Successfully Authenticated!
...
```

In this example, we are sending a request to our API with a valid set of credentials in
the `Authorization` header with the `Basic` prefix and getting back a `200 OK`
response.

You can try it without the header, and you will receive a `401 Unauthorized` prompt
instead.
