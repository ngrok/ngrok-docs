### Behavior

The `set-vars` action allows you to define your own global variables to be used in future actions or expressions. After being defined,
they can be accessed using the `"${vars.<name>}"` syntax within CEL interpolated strings. The variables can be of any valid CEL type,
including strings, booleans, doubles, null, maps, and lists.

#### CEL Interpolation

Strings can also support CEL interpolation, allowing for dynamic values and types. Within string values, you can use the syntax `${<expression>}` to evaluate expressions and include their results in the string.
CEL-interpolated strings that are exactly of the form `"${vars.<name>}"` will resolve to the evaluated type. Strings that contain CEL-interpolated substrings within them such as `sample ${conn.tls.client.pem} here` will convert all CEL-interpolated substrings to strings

#### Scoping

The variables defined in the `set-vars` action are scoped to the Traffic Policy and are not accessible outside of it. Variables defined in each of the three phases (`on_http_request`, `on_http_response`, `on_tcp_connect`) are scoped to that phase, and cannot be accessed in other phases.

#### Referencing other variables and macros

CEL-interpolated strings may reference all other variables and macros available to traffic policies. This also includes variables previously defined in the same or previous `set-vars` actions. This allows for powerful dynamic behavior and customization of your Traffic Policy.
