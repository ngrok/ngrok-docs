### Configuration Fields

| Parameter          | Type       | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `error_threshold`  | `float`    | Threshold percentage of errors that must be met before requests are rejected. Must be a value between `0.0` and `1.0`. Defaults to `0.5`.                    |
| `volume_threshold` | `int`      | Number of requests in a rolling window before checking the error threshold. Must be a number between `1` and `2,000,000,000`. Defaults to `10`.              |
| `window_duration`  | `duration` | Number of seconds in the rolling window that metrics are retained for. Must be a value between `1s` and `2m`. Defaults to `10s`.                             |
| `tripped_duration` | `duration` | Number of seconds the system waits after rejecting a request before re-evaluating upstream health. Must be a value between `1s` and `2m`. Defaults to `10s`. |
| `num_buckets`      | `int`      | Number of buckets that metrics are divided into within the rolling window. Fixed at `10`.                                                                    |
| `enforce`          | `bool`     | Determines if the circuit breaker is active. If `false`, the circuit breaker never trips, and no requests are rejected. Defaults to `true`.                  |
