### Special Paths

Upstream applications behind endpoints with this module enabled do not receive
any requests to paths beginning with `/auth/`. Your application may redirect
clients to the following paths to invoke different behaviors.

#### `/ngrok/login`

Redirect users to this path to explicitly begin an authentication flow. After 
authentication, users will be redirected to `/`. If the IdP supports it, ngrok 
will attempt to instruct the IdP to force re-authentication which will force 
users to re-enter their credentials with the IdP even if they were already 
logged in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

#### `/ngrok/logout` 

Logs the user out by clearing their session cookie. Redirect users to this path 
to log them out.<br /><br />**Note:** When using the Google OAuth 2.0/OIDC 
provider in Chrome with a [managed profile](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/188446), 
`/ngrok/logout` only clears the ngrok session cookie; it does not end the 
Google/IdP session maintained by the browser. Users may be silently 
re-authenticated on the next request. To fully sign out, sign out of 
Chrome/Google (or use a non-managed profile or Incognito) in addition to 
calling `/ngrok/logout`.

### Events

When this module is enabled, it populates the following fields in the
[http_request_complete.v0](/obs/events/reference/#http-request-complete) event:

- `oauth.app_client_id` 
- `oauth.decision`      
- `oauth.user.id`       
- `oauth.user.name`     

### Supported Providers

ngrok currently supports the following OAuth providers (see the Integration Guides for more details). In some instances, ngrok has a
[managed application](/traffic-policy/actions/oauth/#managed-applications) that allows you to configure OAuth without setting up your own application in your provider. This is useful for testing and
development, but when you move into production, we recommend using your own custom application in your specific provider.

| Provider  | Provider Identifier | Managed App Available | Integration Guide                                    |
| --------- | ------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Amazon    | `amazon`            | no                    | [Documentation](/integrations/oauth/oauth/)    |
| Facebook  | `facebook`          | no                    | [Documentation](/integrations/oauth/facebook-oauth)  |
| GitHub    | `github`            | yes                   | [Documentation](/integrations/oauth/github-oauth)    |
| GitLab    | `gitlab`            | yes                   | [Documentation](/integrations/oauth/gitlab-oauth)    |
| Google    | `google`            | yes                   | [Documentation](/integrations/oauth/google-oauth)    |
| LinkedIn  | `linkedin`          | yes                   | [Documentation](/integrations/oauth/linkedin-oauth)  |
| Microsoft | `microsoft`         | yes                   | [Documentation](/integrations/oauth/microsoft-oauth) |
| Twitch    | `twitch`            | yes                   | [Documentation](/integrations/oauth/twitch-oauth)    |

step-by-step integration guides.

## Behavior

### Callback URL

When you create your own OIDC app, you must specify a 'Callback URL' or
'Redirect URL' to the OIDC provider. When using ngrok's OIDC action, that
Callback URL is always:

```
https://idp.ngrok.com/oauth2/callback
```

### Authentication

When an unauthenticated request is made to an OIDC-protected endpoint, it
returns a redirect response that begins an authentication flow with the
configured identity provider. The original URI path is saved so that users can
be redirected to it if they successfully authenticate.

**If the user fails to authenticate with the identity provider**, ngrok will
display an error describing the failure returned by the identity provider and
prompt them to try logging in again.

**If the user successfully authenticates with the identity provider**, ngrok
will take the following actions:

- Check any authorization constraints you've defined (like allowed
  emails or allowed email domains). If the user is not authorized, ngrok renders
  an error and prompts them to try logging in again.
- Sets a [session cookie](#cookies) to avoid repeating the authentication flow again.
- Redirects the user to the original URI path they were attempting to access
  before the authentication flow began. If no such URI path was captured, they
  are redirected to `/`.

### Continuous Authorization

When an authenticated user makes a request, ngrok will sometimes refresh a
user's data from the identity provider (email, name, etc) and re-evaluate
authorization constraints. This refresh is executed as a back channel request to
the identity provider; it is transparent to the user and they do not go through
a re-authentication flow.

The following circumstances trigger refresh and authorization re-evaluation:

- On a periodic interval defined by the [`userinfo_refresh_interval`](/traffic-policy/actions/oidc/#configuration-fields) parameter.
- If you update the OIDC configuration of the endpoint by restarting your
  agent with a new configuration.
- If you update the OIDC configuration of the endpoint.

If a previously authenticated user becomes unauthorized because their identity
provider information changed or because the OIDC action configuration changed,
they are presented an error and are prompted to try logging in again.

### Traffic Identities

ngrok's [Traffic Identities](/traffic-policy/identities/) feature can be used to observe
all of the authenticated user activity across your account in the ngrok
dashboard or via API. Whenever a user authenticates or accesses an endpoint
with a configured OIDC action, their Traffic Identity record is created or updated.

You may also use Traffic Identities to remotely log a user out by [revoking a
session](/traffic-policy/identities/#revoke-sessions).

### Cookies

This action sets two cookies in its operation. Cookies values are opaque to the
upstream service and must not be modified.

| Cookie    | Description                             |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `session` | Used to track an authenticated user.    |
| `nonce`   | Used to secure the authentication flow. |

## Examples

### Using a Managed Provider

The following [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/)
configuration will provide your app with an authentication step.

<CodeGroup>
```yaml policy.yml
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: openid-connect
        config:
          issuer_url: '{your issuer url}'
          client_id: '{your app''s oauth client id}'
          client_secret: '{your app''s oauth client secret}'
          scopes:
            - openid
            - profile
            - email
```

```json policy.json
{
  "on_http_request": [
    {
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "openid-connect",
          "config": {
            "issuer_url": "{your issuer url}",
            "client_id": "{your app's oauth client id}",
            "client_secret": "{your app's oauth client secret}",
            "scopes": [
              "openid",
              "profile",
              "email"
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
