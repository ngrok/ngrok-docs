## Overview

The **Forward Internal** Traffic Policy action enables you to forward traffic from an endpoint to a private endpoint within the same ngrok account. This is useful for safely and securely routing traffic from your public endpoints to other services, giving you the ability to choose when and how your endpoints are made publicly available.
