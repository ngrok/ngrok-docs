</Note>

The **OAuth** Traffic Policy action restricts access to your endpoints to only authorized users by enforcing **OAuth** through an identity provider of your choice.

## Configuration reference

The [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/) configuration reference for this action.

### Supported phases

`on_http_request`

### Type

`oauth`

### Configuration fields

<ConfigField title="provider" type="string" required={true}>
  The name of the _OAuth_ identity provider to be used for authentication.
</ConfigField>

<ConfigField title="auth_id" type="string" required={false}>
  Unique authentication identifier for this provider.
  This value will be used for the cookie, redirect, authentication and logout purposes.

  <Note>
    	To login a user you must use `/ngrok/login?auth_id={auth_id}`.
    	If you are using path based auth you must include the path to be redirected back to:
    	`?redirect_path=/foo`

</Note>
</ConfigField>

<ConfigField title="client_id" type="string" required={false} cel={true}>
  Your OAuth app's client ID.

  <Note>Leave this empty if you want to use ngrok's managed application.</Note>
</ConfigField>

<ConfigField title="client_secret" type="string" required={false} cel={true}>
  Your OAuth app's client secret.

  <Note>Leave this empty if you want to use a managed application.</Note>
</ConfigField>

<ConfigField title="scopes" type="array of strings" required={false}>
  A list of additional scopes to request when users authenticate with the identity provider.
</ConfigField>

<ConfigField title="authz_url_params" type="map of string to string" required={false}>
  {" "}
  A map of additional URL parameters to apply to the authorization endpoint URL.
</ConfigField>

<ConfigField title="max_session_duration" type="duration" required={false}>
  Defines the maximum lifetime of a session regardless of activity.
</ConfigField>

<ConfigField title="idle_session_timeout" type="duration" required={false}>
  Defines the period of inactivity after which a user's session is automatically ended, requiring re-authentication.
</ConfigField>

<ConfigField title="userinfo_refresh_interval" type="duration" required={false}>
  How often should ngrok refresh data about the authenticated user from the identity provider.
</ConfigField>

<ConfigField title="allow_cors_preflight" type="boolean" required={false} defaultValue={false}>
  {" "}
  Allow CORS preflight requests to bypass authentication checks.
  Enable if the endpoint needs to be accessible via CORS.
</ConfigField>

<ConfigField title="auth_cookie_domain" type="string" required={false}>
  Sets the allowed domain for the auth cookie.
</ConfigField>

### Special paths

#### `/ngrok/login`

Redirect users to this path to explicitly begin an authentication flow.
After authentication, users will be redirected to `/`.
If the IdP supports it, ngrok will attempt to instruct the IdP to force re-authentication which will force users to re-enter their credentials with the IdP even if they were already logged in. |

#### `/ngrok/logout`

Logs the user out by clearing their session cookie.
Redirect users to this path to log them out.

<Note>
  When using the Google OAuth 2.0/OIDC provider in Chrome with a [managed profile](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/188446), `/ngrok/logout` only clears the ngrok session cookie; it does not end the Google/IdP session maintained by the browser.
  Users may be silently re-authenticated on the next request.
  To fully sign out, sign out of Chrome/Google (or use a non-managed profile or Incognito) in addition to calling `/ngrok/logout`.
</Note>

### Events

When this action is enabled, it populates the following fields in the [http_request_complete.v0](/obs/events/reference/#http-request-complete) event:

- `oauth.app_client_id`
- `oauth.decision`
- `oauth.user.id`
- `oauth.user.name`

### Supported providers

ngrok currently supports the following OAuth providers (see the Integration Guides for more details).
In some instances, ngrok has a [managed application](#managed-applications) that allows you to configure OAuth without setting up your own application in your provider.
This is useful for testing and development, but when you move into production, use your own custom application in your specific provider.

| Provider | Provider Identifier | Managed App Available | Integration Guide | | --------- | ------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | | Amazon | `amazon` | no | [Documentation](/integrations/oauth/oauth/) | | Facebook | `facebook` | no | [Documentation](/integrations/oauth/facebook-oauth) | | GitHub | `github` | yes | [Documentation](/integrations/oauth/github-oauth) | | GitLab | `gitlab` | yes | [Documentation](/integrations/oauth/gitlab-oauth) | | Google | `google` | yes | [Documentation](/integrations/oauth/google-oauth) | | LinkedIn | `linkedin` | yes | [Documentation](/integrations/oauth/linkedin-oauth) | | Microsoft | `microsoft` | yes | [Documentation](/integrations/oauth/microsoft-oauth) | | Twitch | `twitch` | yes | [Documentation](/integrations/oauth/twitch-oauth) |

### Required scopes

This is a list of the minimum required scopes for each provider.
You can use this when configuring your identity provider.
These are not required when using the ngrok managed applications.

| Provider | Scopes | | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | Amazon | `profile` | | Facebook | `email` | | Github | `read:org`, `read:user` | | Gitlab | `email`, `openid`, `profile` | | Google | `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email`, `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile` | | LinkedIn | `r_emailaddress`, `r_liteprofile` | | Microsoft | `User.Read` | | Twitch | `user:read:email` |

## Try it out

Consult the list of [supported providers](#supported-providers) for step-by-step integration guides.

## Behavior

### Callback URL

When you create your own OAuth app, you must specify a 'Callback URL' or 'Redirect URL' to the OAuth provider.
When using ngrok's OAuth action, that Callback URL is always:

```
https://idp.ngrok.com/oauth2/callback
```

### Authentication

When an unauthenticated request is made to an OAuth-protected endpoint, it returns a redirect response that begins an authentication flow with the configured identity provider.
The original URI path is saved so that users can be redirected to it if they successfully authenticate.

**If the user fails to authenticate with the identity provider**, ngrok will display an error describing the failure returned by the identity provider and prompt them to try logging in again.

**If the user successfully authenticates with the identity provider**, ngrok will take the following actions:

- Sets a [session cookie](#cookies) to avoid repeating the authentication flow again.
- Redirects the user to the original URI path they were attempting to access
  before the authentication flow began.
  If no such URI path was captured, they are redirected to `/`.
- Continue processing the rest of the Traffic Policy actions.

### Continuous authorization

When an authenticated user makes a request, ngrok will sometimes refresh a user's data from the identity provider (email, name, etc.) and re-evaluate authorization constraints.
This refresh is executed as a back channel request to the identity provider; it is transparent to the user and they do not go through a re-authentication flow.

The following circumstances trigger refresh and authorization re-evaluation:

- On a periodic interval defined by the [`userinfo_refresh_interval`](/traffic-policy/actions/oauth/#configuration-fields) parameter.
- If you update the OAuth configuration of the endpoint either in the agent or through the dashboard.
- If you update the OAuth configuration of the endpoint.

If a previously authenticated user becomes unauthorized because their identity provider information changed or because the OAuth action configuration changed, they are presented an error and are prompted to try logging in again.

### Managed applications

Managed applications allow you to use ngrok's OAuth action without setting up your own OAuth apps with the identity providers.
More practically, this means you can use the OAuth action without configuring a client id and client secret.

Managed applications are great for getting started but they have some limitations.

- They are [only available for some identity providers](#supported-providers).
- You may not pass custom scopes when using a managed application.
- The [upstream headers](/universal-gateway/http/#upstream-headers) `ngrok-auth-oauth-access-token` and
  `ngrok-auth-oauth-refresh-token` are not sent to your application.

### Traffic Identities

<TrafficIdentities />

### Cookies

This action sets two cookies in its operation.
Cookies values are opaque to the upstream service and must not be modified.

| Cookie | Description | | --------- | --------------------------------------- | | `session` | Used to track an authenticated user. | | `nonce` | Used to secure the authentication flow. |

### Non-terminating action

<NonTerminatingExplanation />

## Examples

### Using a managed provider

The following [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/) configuration will provide your app with a google authentication step.

<CodeGroup>
  ```yaml policy.yml
  on_http_request:
  - actions:
  - type: oauth
        config:
          provider: google
  ```

```json policy.json
{
  "on_http_request": [
    {
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "oauth",
          "config": {
            "provider": "google"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
</CodeGroup>

The `provider` value can be replaced with any of the [Supported Providers](/traffic-policy/actions/oauth/#supported-providers) that have an a managed app available.

### Restricting access to certain users

See [here](/traffic-policy/examples/add-authentication/#conditional-access-using-oauth-variables) for an example of conditional access based on OAuth result variables.
