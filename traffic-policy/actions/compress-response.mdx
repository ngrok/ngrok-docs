The Compress Response Traffic Policy action enables you to improve the performance of your web applications by compressing HTTP response bodies returned by your upstream service.

## Configuration reference

The [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/) configuration reference for this action.

### Supported phases

`on_http_response`

### Type

`compress-response`

### Configuration fields

<ConfigField title="algorithms" type="array of strings" defaultValue="['gzip', 'deflate', 'br', 'compress']">
  A list of allowed compression algorithms to be considered during encoding type negotiation.
  Each element must be unique.

  <ConfigEnum label="Supported algorithms">
  <ConfigEnumOption>`br`</ConfigEnumOption>
  <ConfigEnumOption>`compress`</ConfigEnumOption>
  <ConfigEnumOption>`deflate`</ConfigEnumOption>
  <ConfigEnumOption>`gzip`</ConfigEnumOption>
  </ConfigEnum>
  
</ConfigField>

## Behavior

When an HTTP request includes an `Accept-Encoding` header, HTTP responses are automatically compressed, and a Content-Encoding header is added to the response.

If the response is already compressed by your upstream service, no additional compression will be applied.

### Streaming compression

When compression is applied, the response body is not buffered; it is compressed in real-time as it streams through the ngrok endpoint.

### Algorithm choice

If a request specifies `Accept-Encoding` but none of the requested algorithms are supported, no compression is applied, and the upstream response is returned unmodified.

### Quality values

Compression is negotiated based on the `Accept-Encoding` header as defined by the [RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#name-accept-encoding), respecting q-values and selecting the supported algorithm with the highest q-value.

For example:

```bash
Accept-Encoding: gzip;q=1.0, br; q=0.5, *;q=0
```

The algorithm `gzip` would be selected because it has the highest q-value of `1.0`.

### Response headers

When this action performs compression, the following changes are made to the HTTP response headers:

- The `Content-Length` header is removed.
- A `Content-Encoding` header is added, specifying the negotiated algorithm.
- A `Vary: Accept-Encoding` header is added to indicate that the response varies
  based on the `Accept-Encoding` request header.

## Examples

### Compressing API responses based on URL path

The following [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/) configuration demonstrates how to set this up using the `compress-response` action with an expression to compress traffic on specific URL paths.

#### Example Traffic Policy document

<CodeGroup>
  ```yaml policy.yml highlight={3}
  on_http_response:
  - expressions:
  - "req.url.path.startsWith('/api/')"
    actions:
  - type: "compress-response"
        config:
          algorithms:
  - "gzip"
  - "br"
  - "deflate"
  - "compress"
  ```
  ```json policy.json highlight={5}
  {
  "on_http_response": [
    {
      "expressions": [
        "req.url.path.startsWith('/api/')"
      ],
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "compress-response",
          "config": {
            "algorithms": [
              "gzip",
              "br",
              "deflate",
              "compress"
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
  }
  ```
  
</CodeGroup>

For this example, assume that an ngrok agent is pointing at the upstream service https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com.

#### Example request

```bash
$ curl -i https://jsonplaceholder.ngrok.app/api/posts
```

```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
content-encoding: gzip
content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8

<compressed-body-here>
```

In this example, when a request is made to `/api/posts`, ngrok compresses the response using one of the specified algorithms (for example, `gzip`).
The response includes the `content-encoding: gzip` header, and the body is compressed accordingly.

This setup ensures that only API responses for paths starting with `/api/` are compressed, enhancing performance and responsiveness for only those endpoints.

## Action result variables

<ActionVariablesDescription />

<ConfigField title="actions.ngrok.compress.already_compressed" type="boolean">
  Indicates whether the body was already compressed before the action was applied.
  Returns <code>true</code> if no further compression was performed.
</ConfigField>

<ConfigField title="actions.ngrok.compress.negotiated_algorithm" type="string">
  The compression algorithm selected and applied by the action, based on the client's request and action configuration.
  
</ConfigField>
