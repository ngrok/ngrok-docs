The Compress Response Traffic Policy action enables you to improve the
performance of your web applications by compressing HTTP response bodies returned
by your upstream service.

## Configuration Reference

The [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/) configuration
reference for this action.

### Supported Phases

`on_http_response`

### Type

`compress-response`

### Configuration Fields

<ConfigField title="algorithms" type="array of strings" defaultValue="['gzip', 'deflate', 'br', 'compress']">
  A list of allowed compression algorithms to be considered during encoding
  type negotiation. Each element must be unique.

  <ConfigEnum label="Supported algorithms">
    <ConfigEnumOption>`br`</ConfigEnumOption>
    <ConfigEnumOption>`compress`</ConfigEnumOption>
    <ConfigEnumOption>`deflate`</ConfigEnumOption>
    <ConfigEnumOption>`gzip`</ConfigEnumOption>
  </ConfigEnum>
</ConfigField>

## Behavior

When an HTTP request includes an `Accept-Encoding` header, HTTP responses are
automatically compressed, and a Content-Encoding header is added to the
response.

If the response is already compressed by your upstream service,
no additional compression will be applied.

### Streaming Compression

When compression is applied, the response body is not buffered; it is
compressed in real-time as it streams through the ngrok endpoint.

### Algorithm Choice

If a request specifies `Accept-Encoding` but none of the requested algorithms
are supported, no compression is applied, and the upstream response is returned
unmodified.

### Quality Values

Compression is negotiated based on the `Accept-Encoding` header as defined by
the [RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#name-accept-encoding),
respecting q-values and selecting the supported algorithm with the highest
q-value.

For example:

```bash
Accept-Encoding: gzip;q=1.0, br; q=0.5, *;q=0
```

The algorithm `gzip` would be selected because it has the highest q-value of `1.0`.

### Response Headers

When this action performs compression, the following changes are made to the
HTTP response headers:

- The `Content-Length` header is removed.
- A `Content-Encoding` header is added, specifying the negotiated algorithm.
- A `Vary: Accept-Encoding` header is added to indicate that the response varies
  based on the `Accept-Encoding` request header.

## Examples

### Compressing API Responses Based on URL Path

The following [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/)
configuration demonstrates how to set this up using the `compress-response`
action with an expression to compress traffic on specific URL paths.

#### Example Traffic Policy Document

<CodeGroup>
```yaml policy.yml highlight={3}
on_http_response:
  - expressions:
      - "req.url.path.startsWith('/api/')"
    actions:
      - type: "compress-response"
        config:
          algorithms:
            - "gzip"
            - "br"
            - "deflate"
            - "compress"
```
```json policy.json highlight={5}
{
  "on_http_response": [
    {
      "expressions": [
        "req.url.path.startsWith('/api/')"
      ],
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "compress-response",
          "config": {
            "algorithms": [
              "gzip",
              "br",
              "deflate",
              "compress"
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
</CodeGroup>

For this example, we are assuming that an ngrok agent is pointing at the
upstream service https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com.

#### Example Request

```bash
$ curl -i https://jsonplaceholder.ngrok.app/api/posts
```

```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
content-encoding: gzip
content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8

<compressed-body-here>
```

In this example, when a request is made to `/api/posts`,
ngrok compresses the response using one of the specified algorithms
(for example, `gzip`). The response includes the `content-encoding: gzip` header, and
the body is compressed accordingly.

This setup ensures that only API responses
for paths starting with `/api/` are compressed, enhancing performance and
responsiveness for only those endpoints.

## Action Result Variables

<ActionVariablesDescription />

<ConfigField title="actions.ngrok.compress.already_compressed" type="boolean">
  Indicates whether the body was already compressed before the action was
  applied. Returns <code>true</code> if no further compression was
  performed.
</ConfigField>

<ConfigField title="actions.ngrok.compress.negotiated_algorithm" type="string">
  The compression algorithm selected and applied by the action, based on the
  client's request and action configuration.
</ConfigField>
