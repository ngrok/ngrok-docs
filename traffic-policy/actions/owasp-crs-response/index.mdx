## Overview

The **OWASP/CRS Response** Traffic Policy action enables OWASP (Open Worldwide Application
Security Project) CRS (previously Core Rule Set), a set of generic attack detection
rules for use with ModSecurity or compatible web application firewalls. It aims to protect
web applications from a wide range of attacks, including the
[OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/), with a minimum of false alerts.
CRS provides protection against many common attack categories, including SQL Injection,
Cross Site Scripting, Local File Inclusion, etc.

The `owasp-crs-response` action only enables rule detection on _outgoing_ HTTP responses from your
endpoint. In addition to this action, it is also recommended to enable the [OWASP/CRS Request
action](/traffic-policy/actions/owasp-crs-request/) to analyze _incoming_ HTTP requests to your endpoint
