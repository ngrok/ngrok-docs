### Compressing API Responses Based on URL Path

The following [Traffic Policy](/docs/http/traffic-policy/)
configuration demonstrates how to set this up using the `compress-response`
action with an expression to compress traffic on specific URL paths.

#### Example Traffic Policy Document

<ConfigExample
	snippetText={null}
	showLineNumbers={true}
	jsonMetastring="{8-18}"
	yamlMetastring="{6-12}"
	config={{
		outbound: [
			{
				expressions: ["req.url.path.startsWith('/api/')"],
				actions: [
					{
						type: "compress-response",
						config: {
							algorithms: ["gzip", "br", "deflate", "compress"],
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>

For this example, we are assuming that an ngrok agent is pointing at the
upstream service https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com.

#### Example Request

```shell
$ curl -i https://jsonplaceholder.ngrok.app/api/posts
```

```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
content-encoding: gzip
content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8

<compressed-body-here>
```

In this example, when a request is made to `/api/posts`,
ngrok compresses the response using one of the specified algorithms
(e.g., `gzip`). The response includes the `content-encoding: gzip` header, and
the body is compressed accordingly.

This setup ensures that only API responses
for paths starting with `/api/` are compressed, enhancing performance and
responsiveness for only those endpoints.
