## Compress Response

The **Compress Response** Traffic Policy action enables you to improve the
performance of your web applications by compressing HTTP response bodies returned
by your upstream service.

### Configuration Reference

The [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/) configuration
reference for this action.

#### Supported Phases

`on_http_request`, `on_http_response`

#### Type

`compress-response`

#### Configuration Fields

<Config>
	<ConfigItem title="algorithms" type="array of strings">
		<p>
			A list of allowed compression algorithms to be considered during encoding
			type negotiation. Each element must be unique.
		</p>
		<p>Defaults to `gzip`, `deflate`, `br`, `compress`.</p>
		<ConfigEnum label="Supported algorithms">
			<ConfigEnumOption>`br`</ConfigEnumOption>
			<ConfigEnumOption>`compress`</ConfigEnumOption>
			<ConfigEnumOption>`deflate`</ConfigEnumOption>
			<ConfigEnumOption>`gzip`</ConfigEnumOption>
		</ConfigEnum>
	</ConfigItem>
</Config>

### Behavior

When an HTTP request includes an `Accept-Encoding` header, HTTP responses are
automatically compressed, and a Content-Encoding header is added to the
response.

If the response is already compressed by your upstream service,
no additional compression will be applied.

#### Streaming Compression

When compression is applied, the response body is not buffered; it is
compressed in real-time as it streams through the ngrok endpoint.

#### Algorithm Choice

If a request specifies `Accept-Encoding` but none of the requested algorithms
are supported, no compression is applied, and the upstream response is returned
unmodified.

#### Quality Values

Compression is negotiated based on the `Accept-Encoding` header as defined by
the [RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#name-accept-encoding),
respecting q-values and selecting the supported algorithm with the highest
q-value.

For example:

```bash
Accept-Encoding: gzip;q=1.0, br; q=0.5, *;q=0
```

The algorithm `gzip` would be selected because it has the highest q-value of `1.0`.

#### Response Headers

When this action performs compression, the following changes are made to the
HTTP response headers:

- The `Content-Length` header is removed.
- A `Content-Encoding` header is added, specifying the negotiated algorithm.
- A `Vary: Accept-Encoding` header is added to indicate that the response varies
  based on the `Accept-Encoding` request header.

### Examples

#### Compressing API Responses Based on URL Path

The following [Traffic Policy](/docs/traffic-policy/)
configuration demonstrates how to set this up using the `compress-response`
action with an expression to compress traffic on specific URL paths.

##### Example Traffic Policy Document

<ConfigExample
	snippetText={null}
	showLineNumbers={true}
	jsonMetastring="{8-18}"
	yamlMetastring="{6-12}"
	config={{
		on_http_response: [
			{
				expressions: ["req.url.path.startsWith('/api/')"],
				actions: [
					{
						type: "compress-response",
						config: {
							algorithms: ["gzip", "br", "deflate", "compress"],
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>

For this example, we are assuming that an ngrok agent is pointing at the
upstream service https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com.

##### Example Request

```bash
$ curl -i https://jsonplaceholder.ngrok.app/api/posts
```

```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
content-encoding: gzip
content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8

<compressed-body-here>
```

In this example, when a request is made to `/api/posts`,
ngrok compresses the response using one of the specified algorithms
(e.g., `gzip`). The response includes the `content-encoding: gzip` header, and
the body is compressed accordingly.

This setup ensures that only API responses
for paths starting with `/api/` are compressed, enhancing performance and
responsiveness for only those endpoints.

### Action Result Variables

<Config>
	<ConfigItem title="actions.ngrok.compress.already_compressed" type="boolean">
		<p>
			Indicates whether the body was already compressed before the action was
			applied. Returns <code>true</code> if no further compression was
			performed.
		</p>
	</ConfigItem>
	<ConfigItem title="actions.ngrok.compress.negotiated_algorithm" type="string">
		<p>
			The compression algorithm selected and applied by the action, based on the
			client's request and action configuration.
		</p>
	</ConfigItem>
</Config>
