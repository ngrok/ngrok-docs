## Behavior

When an HTTP request includes an `Accept-Encoding` header, HTTP responses are
automatically compressed, and a Content-Encoding header is added to the
response.

If the response is already compressed by your upstream service,
no additional compression will be applied.

### Streaming Compression

When compression is applied, the response body is not buffered; it is
compressed in real-time as it streams through the ngrok endpoint.

### Algorithm Choice

If a request specifies `Accept-Encoding` but none of the requested algorithms
are supported, no compression is applied, and the upstream response is returned
unmodified.

### Quality Values

Compression is negotiated based on the `Accept-Encoding` header as defined by
the [RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#name-accept-encoding),
respecting q-values and selecting the supported algorithm with the highest
q-value.

For example:

```shell
Accept-Encoding: gzip;q=1.0, br; q=0.5, *;q=0
```

The algorithm `gzip` would be selected because it has the highest q-value of `1.0`.

### Response Headers

When this action performs compression, the following changes are made to the
HTTP response headers:

- The `Content-Length` header is removed.
- A `Content-Encoding` header is added, specifying the negotiated algorithm.
- A `Vary: Accept-Encoding` header is added to indicate that the response varies
  based on the `Accept-Encoding` request header.
