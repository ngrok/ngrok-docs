The **Remove Headers** Traffic Policy action enables you to remove headers from
an HTTP request before it is sent upstream or from an HTTP response before it is
sent back to the client.

## Configuration Reference

The [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/) configuration
reference for this action.

### Supported Phases

`on_http_request`, `on_http_response`

### Type

`remove-headers`

### Configuration Fields

<ConfigField title="headers" type="array of strings" required={true}>
  List of header keys to remove from the request or response.

  Minimum <code>1</code>, Maximum <code>10</code>.
</ConfigField>

## Behavior

### During `on_http_request`

When executed during the `on_http_request` phase, this action will remove the specified headers from incoming HTTP requests before reaching the upstream server.

### During `on_http_response`

When executed during the `on_http_response`, the configured headers are removed from HTTP responses returned from the upstream server before reaching the client.

### Removal Only

This action will only remove headers from the request or response.

- If you want to add a header use the [`add-headers`](/traffic-policy/actions/add-headers) action.
- If you want to replace a header, first use this action _then_ use the [`add-headers`](/traffic-policy/actions/add-headers) action.

### Ordering

Since actions are run in the order they are specified, to modify headers that have been added by other actions you must place this action
after them in your traffic policy document.

### Special Cases

- You may not add or remove the `user-agent` header.

## Examples

### Removing headers from all requests

We have been getting a lot of requests with `x-client-version` and `x-trace-id`
and it is starting to overwhelm our logging system. We want to remove these headers
from all requests. The following example demonstrates how to remove these headers
using the `remove-headers` action.

#### Example Traffic Policy Document

<CodeGroup>
```yaml policy.yml
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: remove-headers
        config:
          headers:
            - x-client-version
            - x-trace-id
```

```json policy.json
{
  "on_http_request": [
    {
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "remove-headers",
          "config": {
            "headers": [
              "x-client-version",
              "x-trace-id"
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
</CodeGroup>

For this example, we are assuming that ngrok is pointing at the upstream service
https://httpbin.org.

#### Example Request

```bash
$ curl -H "x-client-version: 3.1" -H "x-trace-id: abc123" https://httpbin.ngrok.app/get
< HTTP/2 200

{
...
  "headers": {
    "Date": "2024-06-24T15:30:00Z",
  }
...
}
```

In this example even though we sent the `x-client-version` and `x-trace-id` headers,
they were not present on the request that was sent upstream.
