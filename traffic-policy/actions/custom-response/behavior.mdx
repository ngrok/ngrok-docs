### `on_http_request` Usage

When used during the `on_http_request` phase, this action bypasses the upstream server and
immediately returns the configured response to the caller.

### `on_http_response` Usage

When used during the `on_http_response`, this action overwrites the response from the
upstream server with the configured response.

### Inferring Content-Type

If the `content-type` header is not explicitly specified in `headers`, this
action will attempt to infer the correct `content-type` based on the provided
content.
