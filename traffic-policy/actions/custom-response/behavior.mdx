## Behavior

If this action is executed, no subsequent actions in your traffic policy will 
be executed.

### Inbound Usage

When used as an inbound policy, this action bypasses the upstream server and 
immediately returns the configured response to the caller.

### Outbound Usage

When used as an outbound policy, this action overwrites the response from the 
upstream server with the configured response.

### Inferring Content-Type

If the `content-type` header is not explicitly specified in `headers`, this 
action will attempt to infer the correct `content-type` based on the provided 
content.

### CEL Interpolation

You can access Traffic Policy variables and embed CEL expressions in this
actions configuration values using CEL interpolation in the form of 
`${expression}`. Check out [the examples](#examples) to see this in action. 

For a complete list of variables and how to write expressions, see 
[Expressions](/http/traffic-policy/expressions/variables/) and 
[Variables](/http/traffic-policy/expressions/) documentation.
