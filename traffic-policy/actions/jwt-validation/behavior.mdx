## Behavior

### Request Validation

The request is allowed only if it has been correctly signed by the issuer and
the defined claims match.

### Multiple Issuers

You can specify multiple issuers for JWT validation. A request is
considered validated if it presents a JWT signed by any of the specified
issuers.

The issuer **must** exactly match the one provided in the JWT, including
any trailing slashes (`/`) present in the `iss` claim.

### Multiple Audience Claims

You can specify multiple audience claims for JWT validation.

The JWT **must** contain at least one of the specified audience claims and
exactly match for validation to succeed.

### Multiple Signing Keys

You can provide multiple JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) URLs and signing algorithms.

During JWT validation the list of JWKS and algorithms provided will be used in
an attempt to validate the JWT. The list will be tried in order and is cached
for performance. The cache is refreshed roughly every 15 minutes.

### Multiple Tokens

If multiple tokens are defined within the HTTP configuration parameter, all
tokens **must** be present in the request. If all tokens are not present, a
`401 Unauthorized` status code will be returned.
