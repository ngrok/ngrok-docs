The Redirect Traffic Policy Action enables users to send HTTP `3xx` responses by transforming the incoming URL using a regular expression and optional CEL interpolation. 
It can modify any part of the URL such as scheme, host, port, path, or query, and returns a redirect via the `Location` header.

This action is different from the [URL Rewrite Action](/traffic-policy/actions/url-rewrite/), which changes the request internally while keeping the client's URL unchanged. 
Redirects, by contrast, instruct the client to issue a new request to the new URL.

## Configuration Reference

The [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/) configuration reference for this action.

### Supported Phases

`on_http_request`

### Type

`redirect`

### Configuration Fields

<ConfigField title="from" type="string" required={false} cel={true}>
  A regular expression pattern used to match a part of the URL.
</ConfigField>

<ConfigField title="to" type="string" required={true} cel={true}>
  A regular expression pattern used to replace the matched part of the URL.
</ConfigField>

<ConfigField title="status_code" type="integer" required={false} defaultValue="302">
  A <code>3xx</code> status code used for redirecting.
</ConfigField>

<ConfigField title="headers" type="object" required={false} cel={true}>
  Map of key-value headers to be added to the response.
  Maximum <code>10</code> headers can be specified.
</ConfigField>

## Behavior

The Redirect Action modifies the request URL and returns an HTTP redirect (`3xx`) response. 
It performs the following transformation in sequence:

1. Evaluate any CEL interpolation
2. Apply the regular expression match (`from`)
3. Replace the matched text or URL with the `to` value
4. Send the redirect response

If the rewritten URL is identical to the original, ngrok skips the redirect.

### CEL interpolation

CEL expressions in `${...}` are evaluated before the redirect rule is applied. Interpolations can reference request or connection data. 

For example:

```yaml
to: https://example.com?city=${conn.geo.city}
```

If the request originates from San Francisco, the final redirect target is:

```
https://example.com?city=San%20Francisco
```

### Matching

The `from` field is a **regular expression** evaluated against the entire URL (scheme, host, port, path, query, and fragment). Matching is not anchored by default; a substring match anywhere in the URL triggers the redirect.

#### Example

The following example redirects any request that contains `/api/v1/` to `/api/v2/`. The redirect is applied to the entire URL, not just the path.

```yaml
from: /api/v1/
to: /api/v2/
```

Given the above, `https://example.com/foobar/api/v1/users` would be redirected to `https://example.com/foobar/api/v2/users`.

#### Anchoring / Path Prefix

Anchoring with `^/api/v1/` will not match paths that include the full scheme. To match only the path, use one of the following methods:

<CodeGroup>

```yaml Regular Expressions
# Anchor the full URL, capture authority, and rewrite the path segment.
from: ^((?:https?)://[^/]+)/api/v1/(.*)$
to: $1/api/v2/$2
```


```yaml CEL Interpolation
# Compose anchors with CEL to bind the scheme and authority before matching.
from: ^${req.url.scheme}://${req.url.authority}/api/v1/
to: ${req.url.scheme}://${req.url.authority}/api/v2/
```


```yaml Phase Expressions
# Constrain by path in expressions, then use a relative replacement.
on_http_request:
  - expressions:
      - req.url.path.startsWith('/api/v1/')
    actions:
      - type: redirect
        config:
		  from: /api/v1/
          to: /api/v2/
```

</CodeGroup>

### Replacement behavior

The `to` value replaces what was matched by `from`. 
The replacement is relative to the `from` match. 
When `from` is omitted, the redirect action replaces the entire URL. 
Capture groups (such as `$1`, `$2`) can be used to insert matched text into the replacement. 

When `from` matches a substring, only that segment changes:

```yaml
from: /v1/
to: /v2/
```

Given the above, `https://example.com/api/v1/users` would be redirected to `https://example.com/api/v2/users`.

#### Relative vs. absolute replacements

The `to` value is applied relative to the `from` match. When `from` matches part of the URL, only that segment is replaced. When `from` is omitted, ngrok treats the entire URL as matched and replaces it absolutely.

**Relative example**

```yaml
from: /old
to: https://new.example.com/blog
```

Given the above, `https://example.com/old/foo` would become `https://example.com/https://new.example.com/blog/foo`.

**Absolute example**

When a partial match exists, the replacement is relative; when no `from` match is defined, it is absolute:

```yaml
to: https://new.example.com/blog
```

Given the above, any request to `https://example.com` would be redirected to `https://new.example.com/blog`.

**Redirecting to another host**

To redirect cleanly to a new host, match the entire URL:

```yaml
from: ^https?://[^/]+/old/(.*)$
to: https://new.example.com/new/$1
```

Given the above, `https://example.com/old/foo` would be redirected to `https://new.example.com/new/foo`.

<Note>
If the rewritten URL equals the original, ngrok skips the redirect.
</Note>

### Redirect response

After replacement, the redirect action sends an HTTP redirect with the computed `Location` header. The default status code is `302 Found`.

| Code    | Description        | Behavior                                                             |
| ------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **301** | Moved Permanently  | Clients may cache the redirect.                                      |
| **302** | Found (default)    | Temporary redirect; some clients change the request method to `GET`. |
| **303** | See Other          | Forces the next request to use `GET`.                                |
| **307** | Temporary Redirect | Preserves the original request method and body.                      |
| **308** | Permanent Redirect | Preserves the original request method and body.                      |

You can also include up to 10 custom headers in the redirect response.

**Example**

```yaml
from: ^(https?://[^/]+)/products(.*)$
to: $1/store/products$2
status_code: 301
headers:
  x-redirected: true
```

**Result**

```
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
location: https://example.ngrok.app/store/products
x-redirected: true
```

Once the redirect is sent, the action ends the current phase and no further actions are executed.

## Examples

### Redirect using Paths

The following [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/) configuration demonstrates how to use the `redirect` action to redirect incoming requests from `/products` to `/store/products`.

#### Example Traffic Policy Document

<CodeGroup>

```yaml policy.yml
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: redirect
        config:
          from: ^(https?://[^/]+)/products(.*)$
          to: $1/store/products$2
```


```json policy.json
{
  "on_http_request": [
    {
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "redirect",
          "config": {
            "from": "^(https?://[^/]+)/products(.*)$",
            "to": "$1/store/products$2"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

This configuration will redirect any request from `/products` to `/store/products` with the default `302 Found` status code.

#### Example request

```bash
$ curl -i https://example.ngrok.app/products
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
location: https://example.ngrok.app/store/products
```

In this example, a request to `/products` will be redirected to `/store/products` with a `302 Found` status code, and the `Location` header will indicate the new URL.

### Redirect using Regular Expressions

The following [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/) configuration demonstrates how to use the `redirect` action to redirects requests from an old API endpoint to a new one.

#### Example Traffic Policy Document

<CodeGroup>

```yaml policy.yml
on_http_request:
  - expressions:
      - req.url.path.startsWith('/api/')
    actions:
      - type: redirect
        config:
          from: /api/v1/users?id=([0-9]+)
          to: /api/v2/users/$1/
          status_code: 301
          headers:
            x-redirected: 'true'
```


```json policy.json
{
  "on_http_request": [
    {
      "expressions": [
        "req.url.path.startsWith('/api/')"
      ],
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "redirect",
          "config": {
            "from": "/api/v1/users?id=([0-9]+)",
            "to": "/api/v2/users/$1/",
            "status_code": 301,
            "headers": {
              "x-redirected": "true"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

In this configuration we match requests from `/api/v1/users?id=([0-9]+)` and redirect them to `/api/v2/users/$1/` with a `301` status code. Additionally, a custom header `x-redirected: true` is added to the response.

#### Example Request

```bash
$ curl -i https://example.ngrok.app/api/v1/users?id=123
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
location: https://example.ngrok.app/api/v2/users/123/
x-redirected: true
```

The request will be redirected to the new URL `/api/v2/users/123/`, with a `301 Moved Permanently` status and a custom header.

### Redirect with CEL Interpolation

The following [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/) configuration demonstrates how to use the `redirect` action to redirect users while using CEL Interpolation.

#### Example Traffic Policy Document

<CodeGroup>

```yaml policy.yml {7}
on_http_request:
  - expressions:
      - req.url.path in ['/api/v2/geo', '/api/v2/geo/']
    actions:
      - type: redirect
        config:
          to: /api/v2/geo?city=${conn.geo.city}
```


```json policy.json {11}
{
  "on_http_request": [
    {
      "expressions": [
        "req.url.path in ['/api/v2/geo', '/api/v2/geo/']"
      ],
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "redirect",
          "config": {
            "to": "/api/v2/geo?city=${conn.geo.city}"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

This configuration will redirect any request from `/api/v2/geo` or `/api/v2/geo/` to `/api/v2/geo?city=${conn.geo.city}` using CEL Interpolation to insert the city from the connection's geolocation data.

#### Example Request

```bash
$ curl -i https://example.ngrok.app/api/v2/geo
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
location: https://example.ngrok.app/api/v2/geo?city=San%20Francisco
```

In this example, a request to `https://example.ngrok.app/api/v2/geo` will be redirected to `https://example.ngrok.app/api/v2/geo?city=San Francisco`, with the `302 Found` status code and the `Location` header indicating the new URL that includes the city from the connection's geolocation data.
