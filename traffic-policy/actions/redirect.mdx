The **Redirect** Traffic Policy action enables you redirect incoming requests to
new URLs by modifying the original URLs with regular expressions. Redirection is
performed using the `Location` header.

## Configuration Reference

The [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/) configuration
reference for this action.

### Supported Phases

`on_http_request`

### Type

`redirect`

### Configuration Fields

<ConfigField title="from" type="string" required={false} cel={true}>
  A regular expression pattern used to match a part of the URL.
</ConfigField>

<ConfigField title="to" type="string" required={true} cel={true}>
  A regular expression pattern used to replace the matched part of the URL.
</ConfigField>

<ConfigField title="status_code" type="integer" required={false} defaultValue="302">
  A <code>3xx</code> status code used for redirecting.
</ConfigField>

<ConfigField title="headers" type="object" required={false} cel={true}>
  Map of key-value headers to be added to the response.
  Maximum <code>10</code> headers can be specified.
</ConfigField>

## Behavior

If the specified `from` regular expression matches the request URL, the URL will
be modified according to the `to` field. If no `from` field is specified, the
entire URL will be treated as a match.

When a match is found and the request URL is modified by the `to` field, the
action will return a temporary `302` redirect by default, unless specified
otherwise through the `status_code` field.

If the request URL is not changed, the action will take no further action.

### Note about CEL Interpolation

All CEL interpolation will occur **before** regular expressions
are evaluated.

## Examples

### Redirect using Paths

The following [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/)
configuration demonstrates how to use the `redirect` action to redirect incoming
requests from `/products` to `/store/products`.

#### Example Traffic Policy Document

<CodeGroup>
```yaml policy.yml
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: redirect
        config:
          from: /products
          to: /store/products
```

```json policy.json
{
  "on_http_request": [
    {
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "redirect",
          "config": {
            "from": "/products",
            "to": "/store/products"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
</CodeGroup>

This configuration will redirect any request from `/products` to `/store/products`
with the default `302 Found` status code.

#### Example Request

```bash
$ curl -i https://example.ngrok.app/products
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
location: https://example.ngrok.app/store/products
```

In this example, a request to `/products` will be redirected to `/store/products`
with a `302 Found` status code, and the `Location` header will indicate the new
URL.


### Redirect using Regular Expressions

The following [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/)
configuration demonstrates how to use the `redirect` action to redirects
requests from an old API endpoint to a new one.

#### Example Traffic Policy Document

<CodeGroup>
```yaml policy.yml
on_http_request:
  - expressions:
      - req.url.path.startsWith('/api/')
    actions:
      - type: redirect
        config:
          from: /api/v1/users?id=([0-9]+)
          to: /api/v2/users/$1/
          status_code: 301
          headers:
            x-redirected: 'true'
```

```json policy.json
{
  "on_http_request": [
    {
      "expressions": [
        "req.url.path.startsWith('/api/')"
      ],
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "redirect",
          "config": {
            "from": "/api/v1/users?id=([0-9]+)",
            "to": "/api/v2/users/$1/",
            "status_code": 301,
            "headers": {
              "x-redirected": "true"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
</CodeGroup>

In this configuration we match requests from `/api/v1/users?id=([0-9]+)` and
redirect them to `/api/v2/users/$1/` with a `301` status code. Additionally, a
custom header `x-redirected: true` is added to the response.

#### Example Request

```bash
$ curl -i https://example.ngrok.app/api/v1/users?id=123
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
location: https://example.ngrok.app/api/v2/users/123/
x-redirected: true
```

The request will be redirected to the new URL `/api/v2/users/123/`, with a
`301 Moved Permanently` status and a custom header.

### Redirect with CEL Interpolation

The following [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/)
configuration demonstrates how to use the `redirect` action to redirect users
while using CEL Interpolation.

#### Example Traffic Policy Document

<CodeGroup>
```yaml policy.yml {7}
on_http_request:
  - expressions:
      - req.url.path in ['/api/v2/geo', '/api/v2/geo/']
    actions:
      - type: redirect
        config:
          to: /api/v2/geo?city=${conn.geo.city}
```

```json policy.json {11}
{
  "on_http_request": [
    {
      "expressions": [
        "req.url.path in ['/api/v2/geo', '/api/v2/geo/']"
      ],
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "redirect",
          "config": {
            "to": "/api/v2/geo?city=${conn.geo.city}"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
</CodeGroup>

This configuration will redirect any request from `/api/v2/geo` or `/api/v2/geo/`
to `/api/v2/geo?city=${conn.geo.city}` using CEL Interpolation to insert the
city from the connection's geolocation data.

#### Example Request

```bash
$ curl -i https://example.ngrok.app/api/v2/geo
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
location: https://example.ngrok.app/api/v2/geo?city=San%20Francisco
```

In this example, a request to `https://example.ngrok.app/api/v2/geo` will be
redirected to `https://example.ngrok.app/api/v2/geo?city=San Francisco`, with
the `302 Found` status code and the `Location` header indicating the new URL
that includes the city from the connection's geolocation data.
