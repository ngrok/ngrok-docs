## Behavior

### Evaluation of Rules

This action evaluates the configured rules against the layer 4 source IP
(`conn.client_ip`) of a connection. HTTP headers like `X-Forwarded-For` are
never used.

### Allow and Deny Conditions

A connection is allowed only if its source IP matches at least one of the
allowed CIDRs and does not match any of the denied CIDRs.

### Building CIDR Sets

The set of allowed and denied CIDRs are built from:

- The CIDRs specified in the `allow` and `deny` fields.
- The CIDRs belonging to the ngrok [IP Policies](/docs/api/resources/ip-policies/)
  specified in the `ip_policies` field.

### Denied Connection Handling

If this action denies the connection:

- An `HTTP 403` response is returned.
- The upstream server is never reached.
- No further actions or policy rules in the policy configuration will be executed.

### IPv6 Support

This action supports IPv6 addresses for all IP rules. You may use standard
abbreviated notations such as `"::/0"`.

Don't forget to create IPv6 rules. It is easy to test with only IPv4 and then
suddenly things don't work as expected because you forgot to create IPv6 rules.
