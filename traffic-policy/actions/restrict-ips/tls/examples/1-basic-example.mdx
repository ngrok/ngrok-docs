### Restricting Access with Allow and Deny Lists

The following [Traffic Policy](/docs/tls/traffic-policy/)
configuration demonstrates how to restrict access to specific IP addresses
using the `restrict-ips` action.

#### Example Traffic Policy Document

<ConfigExample
	snippetText={null}
	showLineNumbers={true}
	yamlMetastring="{4-10}"
	jsonMetastring="{5-16}"
	config={{
		on_tcp_connect: [
			{
				actions: [
					{
						type: "restrict-ips",
						config: {
							enforce: true,
							allow: ["1.1.1.1/32"],
							deny: ["e680:5791:be4c:5739:d959:7b94:6d54:d4b4/128"],
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>

This configuration will ensure that only requests from the IP `1.1.1.1` are
allowed, while requests from the IP `e680:5791:be4c:5739:d959:7b94:6d54:d4b4`
are denied.

#### Example Request

If the request comes from an allowed IP, the response will proceed as normal. If
the request comes from a denied IP, the connection to the server will be
immediately closed:

```shell
$ curl --insecure https://example.ngrok.app
curl: (52) Empty reply from server
```
