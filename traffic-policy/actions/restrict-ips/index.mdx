## Overview

The **Restrict IPs** Traffic Policy action enables you to allow or deny traffic
based on the source IP of the connection that was initiated to your ngrok
endpoints.

You can define rules in two ways, with allow and deny lists or with identifiers
to existing ngrok [IP Policies](/docs/api/resources/ip-policies/).
