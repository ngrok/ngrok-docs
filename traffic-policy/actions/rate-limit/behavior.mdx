## Behavior

### Determining the Rate Limit Bucket

When this action is executed, information from the incoming HTTP request is
used to determine which rate limit bucket the request falls into. Each bucket
is defined by specific criteria through the `bucket_key` configuration field
such as client IP, request host, or a header value.

If the bucket has not exceeded its capacity, the request proceeds to the next
action in your policy configuration.

## Multiple Buckets
If multiple `bucket_key` values are specified, the action will create a
unique rate limit bucket for each combination of the specified keys. For
example, if you have two `bucket_key` values, such as `req.host` and `conn.client_ip`, 
all incoming requests that have the exact same combination of `Host` header and client IP
will be grouped into the same rate limit bucket. To rate limit separately with two different 
buckets, you can create multiple `rate-limit` actions instead.

### Rate Limit Exceeded

If the identified bucket has received more events than its capacity over the
specified duration:

1. The request is rejected with an `HTTP 429 — Too Many Requests` status code.
2. The `retry-after` header is included in the response, indicating the number
   of seconds after which the request may be retried.

### Capacity per Ingress Server

Currently, the `capacity` for each rate limit bucket is applied per ingress
server. This means that each server independently tracks the number of requests
and enforces the rate limits accordingly.
