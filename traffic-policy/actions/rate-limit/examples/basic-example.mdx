### Rate Limit by Host Header

The following [Traffic Policy](/docs/http/traffic-policy/)
configuration demonstrates how to use the `rate-limit` action to rate limit
all incoming requests by the `Host` header.

#### Example Traffic Policy Document

<ConfigExample
	snippetText={null}
	showLineNumbers={true}
	jsonMetastring="{5-13}"
	yamlMetastring="{4-8}"
	config={{
		inbound: [
			{
				actions: [
					{
						type: "rate-limit",
						config: {
							name: "Only allow 30 requests per minute",
							algorithm: "sliding_window",
							capacity: 30,
							rate: "60s",
							bucket_key: ["req.headers['host']"],
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>

For this example, we are assuming that ngrok is pointing at the upstream service
https://httpbin.org.

#### Example Request

```shell
$ curl https://httpbin.ngrok.app/get
```

```http
HTTP/2 429
retry-after: 24
```

In this example, we attempt to connect to `httpbin.ngrok.app` using the `curl`
command and get back a `429` status code with a `retry-after` header telling us
the number of seconds we must wait before retrying the request.
