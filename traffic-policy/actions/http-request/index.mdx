## Overview

The HTTP Request Traffic Policy action performs an outbound HTTP request to a target URL. You can use it to integrate with external services through internal endpoints or—if enabled—with external APIs.

> **Note:** External requests are supported but disabled by default. [Contact ngrok support](https://ngrok.com/support) to enable external access.
