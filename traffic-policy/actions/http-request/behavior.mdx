## Behavior

The `http-request` action issues an outbound HTTP request during either the `on_http_request` or `on_http_response` phase of policy execution. It can include dynamic headers, query parameters, and a request body.

Only specific HTTP methods are supported: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, and `OPTIONS`. If no method is specified, `GET` is used by default.

### Internal Endpoint Behavior

By default, the `http-request` action only supports requests to internal ngrok endpoints. Requests to internal endpoints (those with `.internal` domains) are treated differently from public (or external) requests, these requests must resolve to an internal ngrok endpoint running on your account.

These requests also use a direct connection over ngrok's control plane and do not rely on the public internet. If the request targets an internal agent endpoint (e.g., your self-hosted ngrok agent), it will exit the control plane and traverse the public internet to reach your agent running locally.

### Retry Logic

You can use a condition to automatically retry failed requests. This is useful for handling transient errors, like a `500` response. The condition is written using an expression language and has access to:

- `attempts`: number of attempts so far
- `last_attempt.req`: the most recent request
- `last_attempt.res`: the most recent response
- `last_attempt.error`: any error that occurred

```js
last_attempt.res.statusCode == 500
```

The request will retry up to **3 times**.

### Timeout Behavior

The `timeout` setting defines the **maximum total time** allowed for the entire `http-request` action, including **all** retry attempts. This prevents long-running or stalled requests from delaying policy evaluation.

The default timeout is `3s`. You can configure any duration between **1 second** and **30 seconds** using standard duration formats like `5s` or `10s`.

#### Timeout Error Handling

Whether a timeout causes the policy to fail or continue depends on the `on_error` setting:

- `halt` will treat the timeout as a hard failure.
- `continue` will move forward even if the request timed out.

### Loop Protection

To prevent endless loops between services, ngrok tracks internal hops. If the same request loops more than 3 times internally, it will be stopped automatically.

### Redirect Behavior

By default, the `http-request` action does not follow HTTP redirects. You can enable redirect handling by setting the `max_redirects` field. The allowed range is `0` to `5`. By default it is set to `0`.

If the number of redirects exceeds `max_redirects`, the action fails. Redirect handling only applies to `3xx` responses from the target server.

### Response Body Size Limits

The response body returned by the `http-request` action is limited to **256 KB**. If the body size exceeds this limit, the action fails and returns a `response size exceeded` error.

This limit applies to the decoded body after any decompression and before retries are evaluated.

Each retry is also subject to the **256 KB** response size limit. If the response body exceeds this limit, the attempt fails and the error is included in the `retry_condition` evaluation.

### Error Handling

Set `on_error` to control what happens if the request fails:

- `continue`: Policy continues even if the request fails.
- `halt`: Policy stops immediately on failure.

This gives you control over how critical the request is to your policy logic.

### Automatically Injected Headers

ngrok automatically injects some headers into your request to help with debugging, tracing and abuse:

| Header               | Purpose                                      |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `Ngrok-Report-Abuse` | Static URL for reporting abuse               |
| `Ngrok-Req-Type`     | Always set to `http-request`                 |
| `Ngrok-Req-Id`       | Unique request identifier                    |
| `X-Forwarded-For`    | Original client IP address                   |
| `User-Agent`         | Identifies the request as from `ngrok/cloud` |

### CEL Interpolation

Certain fields in the `http-request` action support CEL (Common Expression Language) interpolation, allowing dynamic values based on the request context.

The following fields support CEL expressions:

- `url`
- `headers` (values only)
- `query_params` (values only)
- `body`

Expressions must be wrapped in `${...}` and are evaluated at runtime using the current request data.
