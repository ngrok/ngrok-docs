### Adding Client IP Headers to all HTTP requests

The following [Traffic Policy](/docs/http/traffic-policy/)
configuration will add the client IP address to all HTTP requests.

#### Example Traffic Policy Document

<ConfigExample
	snippetText={null}
	showLineNumbers={true}
	yamlMetastring="{4-7}"
	jsonMetastring="{5-12}"
	config={{
		on_http_request: [
			{
				actions: [
					{
						type: "add-headers",
						config: {
							headers: {
								"x-client-ip": "${conn.client_ip}",
							},
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>

For this example, we are assuming that ngrok is pointing at the upstream service
https://httpbin.org and we are adding the following header to all requests:

- `x-client-ip` with the value `${conn.client_ip}` to demonstrate the use of
  CEL interpolation to include the client IP address.

#### Example Request

```shell
$ curl -i https://httpbin.ngrok.app/get
```

```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
content-type: application/json

{
  "headers": {
    "X-Client-Ip": "2600:1700:4fa6:1a00:2051:938:7373:5563",
  }
}
```
