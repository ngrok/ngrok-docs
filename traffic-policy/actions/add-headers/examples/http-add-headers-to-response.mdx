### Adding headers to an HTTP response

The following [Traffic Policy](/docs/http/traffic-policy/)
configuration will add headers to the response from the upstream service when
the method is `GET` and the URL starts with `/status/200`.

#### Example Traffic Policy Document

<ConfigExample
	snippetText={null}
	showLineNumbers={true}
	yamlMetastring="{6-10}"
	jsonMetastring="{8-16}"
	config={{
		on_http_response: [
			{
				expressions: [
					'req.method == "GET" && req.url.path.startsWith("/status/200")',
				],
				actions: [
					{
						type: "add-headers",
						config: {
							headers: {
								"x-custom-header": "my-custom-value",
								"x-string-interpolation-example": "started at ${conn.ts.start}",
							},
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>

For this example, we are assuming that ngrok is pointing at the upstream service
https://httpbin.org and we will be adding two headers:

- `x-custom-header` with the value `my-custom-value`
- `x-string-interpolation-example` with the value `started at ${conn.ts.start}`
  to demonstrate the use of CEL interpolation to include the request connection
  start time.

#### Example Request

```shell
$ curl -i https://httpbin.ngrok.app/status/200
```

```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
x-custom-header: my-custom-value
x-string-interpolation-example: started at 2024-07-13T00:10:16Z
```
