## Add Headers

The **Add Headers** Traffic Policy action enables you to add headers to an HTTP
request before it is sent upstream or an HTTP response before it is sent back to
the client.

### Configuration Reference

The [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/) configuration
reference for this action.

#### Supported Phases

`on_http_request`, `on_http_response`

#### Type

`add-headers`

#### Configuration Fields

<Config>
	<ConfigItem title="headers" type="object" cel={true}>
		<p>Map of header key to header value to be added.</p>
		<p>Minimum `1`, Maximum `10`.</p>
		<p>
			Supports [CEL Interpolation](/traffic-policy/concepts/cel-interpolation)
			in header values.
		</p>
	</ConfigItem>
</Config>

### Behavior

When configured in the `on_http_request` phase, this action will add the specified headers to incoming http requests before reaching the upstream server. When
configured in the `on_http_response` phase, the specified headers are added to the http response from the upstream server.

#### Addition Only

This action will only add headers to the request or response. If the header already exists
it will append another header with the same key unless it is the `host` header,
see [Special Cases](#special-cases).

To replace or remove headers use the [`remove-headers`](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/remove-headers) action then
add the header with the desired value.

#### Case Sensitivity

Header keys added through this action are normalized to lowercase per the [HTTP/2 specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7540#section-8.1.2).

#### Ordering

Since actions are run in the order they are specified, to modify headers that have been added by other actions you must place this action
after them in your traffic policy document.

#### Special Cases

- Adding the `host` header override the existing value instead of appending another header.
- You may not add or remove the `user-agent` header.
- You may not use this action to add the `ngrok-skip-browser-warning` header to skip the ngrok browser warning on free accounts. For more information, check out the [free plan limits guide](http://localhost:3000/docs/guides/limits/#why-is-there-an-interstitial-in-front-of-my-html-content).

### Examples

#### Adding headers to an HTTP response

The following [Traffic Policy](/docs/traffic-policy/)
configuration will add headers to the response from the upstream service when
the method is `GET` and the URL starts with `/status/200`.

##### Example Traffic Policy Document

<ConfigExample
	snippetText={null}
	showLineNumbers={true}
	yamlMetastring="{6-10}"
	jsonMetastring="{8-16}"
	config={{
		on_http_response: [
			{
				expressions: [
					'req.method == "GET" && req.url.path.startsWith("/status/200")',
				],
				actions: [
					{
						type: "add-headers",
						config: {
							headers: {
								"x-custom-header": "my-custom-value",
								"x-string-interpolation-example": "started at ${conn.ts.start}",
							},
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>

For this example, we are assuming that ngrok is pointing at the upstream service
https://httpbin.org and we will be adding two headers:

- `x-custom-header` with the value `my-custom-value`
- `x-string-interpolation-example` with the value `started at ${conn.ts.start}`
  to demonstrate the use of CEL interpolation to include the request connection
  start time.

#### Example Request

```bash
$ curl -i https://httpbin.ngrok.app/status/200
```

```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
x-custom-header: my-custom-value
x-string-interpolation-example: started at 2024-07-13T00:10:16Z
```
