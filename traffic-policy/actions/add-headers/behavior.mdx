## Behavior

When executed as an inbound policy, this action will add headers on an incoming http request before reaching the upstream server with
the configured headers. When executed as an outbound policy, the configured headers are added to the response from the upstream server.

### Addition Only

This action will only add headers to the request or response. If the header already exists
it will append another header with the same key unless it is the `host` header,
see [Special Cases](#special-cases).

To replace or remove headers use the [`remove-headers`](/docs/http/traffic-policy/actions/remove-headers) action then
add the header with the desired value.

### Case Sensitivity

Header keys added through this action are normalized to lowercase per the [HTTP/2 specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7540#section-8.1.2).

### Ordering

Since actions are run in the order they are specified, to modify headers that have been added by other actions you must place this action
after them in your traffic policy document.

### CEL Interpolation

You can access Traffic Policy variables and embed CEL expressions in this
actions configuration values using CEL interpolation in the form of
`${expression}`. Check out [the examples](#examples) to see this in action.

For a complete list of variables and how to write expressions, see
[Expressions](/http/traffic-policy/expressions/variables/) and
[Variables](/http/traffic-policy/expressions/) documentation.

### Special Cases

- Adding the `host` header override the existing value instead of appending another header.
- You may not add or remove the `user-agent` header.
- You may not use this action to add the `ngrok-skip-browser-warning` header to skip the ngrok browser warning on free accounts. For more information, check out the [free plan limits guide](http://localhost:3000/docs/guides/limits/#why-is-there-an-interstitial-in-front-of-my-html-content).
