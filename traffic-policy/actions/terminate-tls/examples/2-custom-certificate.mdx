### Using a Custom Certificate

If you want to specify a custom certificate for your endpoints instead of having ngrok manage the certificate for you, you can use the `server_private_key` and `server_certificate` fields in the configuration. This will allow you to have full control over which certificate is used for your endpoint.

#### Generate Certificates

We will create a new Certificate Authority (CA) that will be used to sign the server certificate. This allows you to generate multiple server certificates that are trusted by the CA if needed. Note that this generates a self-signed certificate, so if you would like to use a custom certificate that is trusted by modern operating systems and browsers you will need to use a trusted CA (e.g. LetsEncrypt).

```bash
# 1. Generate CA private key (ca.key)
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out ca.key -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048

# 2. Generate CA certificate (ca.crt)
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key ca.key -sha256 -days 365 -out ca.crt -subj "/CN=ExampleCA"

# 3. Generate server private key (server.key)
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out server.key -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048

# 4. Generate server certificate signing request (CSR) (server.csr)
# NOTE: change terminate-tls-example.ngrok.app to the domain you are using with your endpoint
openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr -subj "/CN=terminate-tls-example.ngrok.app"

# 5. Generate server certificate (server.crt)
openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out server.crt -days 365 -sha256
```

These commands will result in five new files: `ca.key`, `ca.crt`, `server.key`, `server.csr`, and `server.key`. You will use the contents of `server.key` and `server.crt` in your traffic policy to enable your custom certificate on your endpoint and `ca.crt` in order to trust the certificate when using `curl`.

#### Example Traffic Policy Document

<ConfigExample
	snippetText={null}
	showLineNumbers={true}
	jsonMetastring="{5-11}"
	yamlMetastring="{4-13}"
	config={{
		on_tcp_connect: [
			{
				actions: [
					{
						type: "terminate-tls",
						config: {
							server_private_key:
								"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n... private key ...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----",
							server_certificate:
								"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n... certificate ...\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----",
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>

#### Start an Endpoint with the Traffic Policy

```shell
ngrok http 8080 --url https://terminate-tls-example.ngrok.app --traffic-policy-file /path/to/policy.yml
```

#### Make a Request

Now you can make a request to the endpoint with the `--cacert` flag to specify the CA certificate that we generated.

```shell
curl --cacert ca.crt https://terminate-tls-example.ngrok.app
```

If you have a service running on port `8080`, your request will be forwarded to that service. If you don't have any service running on that port, ngrok will return an error page but the certificate setup will have worked!
