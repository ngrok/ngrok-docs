### Minimum and Maximum TLS Versions

This example sets the minimum and maximum TLS versions that the endpoint will support for incoming connections to TLS version 1.3. Clients can then only connect to the endpoint using TLS version 1.3 and will receive a handshake error if they attempt to connect using a different version.

#### Example Traffic Policy Document

<ConfigExample
	snippetText={null}
	showLineNumbers={true}
	jsonMetastring="{5-11}"
	yamlMetastring="{4-7}"
	config={{
		on_tcp_connect: [
			{
				actions: [
					{
						type: "terminate-tls",
						config: {
							min_version: "1.3",
							max_version: "1.3",
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>

#### Start an Endpoint with the Traffic Policy

```shell
ngrok http 8080 --url https://terminate-tls-example.ngrok.app --traffic-policy-file /path/to/policy.yml
```

#### Make a Request

```shell
curl https://terminate-tls-example.ngrok.app
```

If your curl was built with a version of OpenSSL that supports TLS 1.3, the request will succeed. However, we can verify that the endpoint only supports TLS 1.3 by telling curl to use a different version of TLS:

```shell
curl https://terminate-tls-example.ngrok.app --tlsv1.2 --tls-max 1.2
```

You should receive a "alert protocol version" error indicating that the endpoint only supports TLS 1.3.
