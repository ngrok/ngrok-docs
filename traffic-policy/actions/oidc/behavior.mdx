## Behavior

### Callback URL

When you create your own OIDC app, you must specify a 'Callback URL' or
'Redirect URL' to the OIDC provider. When using ngrok's OIDC action, that
Callback URL is always:

```
https://idp.ngrok.com/oauth2/callback
```

### Authentication

When an unauthenticated request is made to an OIDC-protected endpoint, it
returns a redirect response that begins an authentication flow with the
configured identity provider. The original URI path is saved so that users can
be redirected to it if they successfully authenticate.

**If the user fails to authenticate with the identity provider**, ngrok will
display an error describing the failure returned by the identity provider and
prompt them to try logging in again.

**If the user successfully authenticates with the identity provider**, ngrok
will take the following actions:

- Check any authorization constraints you've defined (like allowed
  emails or allowed email domains). If the user is not authorized, ngrok renders
  an error and prompts them to try logging in again.
- Sets a [session cookie](#cookies) to avoid repeating the authentication flow again.
- Redirects the user to the original URI path they were attempting to access
  before the authentication flow began. If no such URI path was captured, they
  are redirected to `/`.

### Continuous Authorization

When an authenticated user makes a request, ngrok will sometimes refresh a
user's data from the identity provider (email, name, etc) and re-evaluate
authorization constraints. This refresh is executed as a backchannel request to
the identity provider; it is transparent to the user and they do not go through
a reauthentication flow.

The following circumstances trigger refresh and authorization re-evaluation:

- On a periodic interval defined by the [userinfo_refresh_interval](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/oidc/#configuration-fields) parameter.
- If you update the OIDC configuration of the endpoint by restarting your
  agent with a new configuration.
- If you update the OIDC configuration of the endpoint.

If a previously authenticated user becomes unauthorized because their identity
provider information changed or because the OIDC action configuration changed,
they are presented an error and are prompted to try logging in again.

### App Users

ngrok's [App Users](/docs/network-edge/app-users/) feature can be used to observe
all of the authenticated user activity across your account in the ngrok
dashboard or via API. Whenever a user authenticates or accesses an endpoint
with a configured OIDC action, their App User record is created or updated.

You may also use App Users to remotely log a user out by [revoking a
session](/network-edge/app-users/#revoke-sessions).

### Cookies

This action sets two cookies in its operation. Cookies values are opaque to the
upstream service and must not be modified.

| Cookie    | Description                             |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `session` | Used to track an authenticated user.    |
| `nonce`   | Used to secure the authentication flow. |
