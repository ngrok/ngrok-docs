## Behavior

### On `on_http_request`

When executed during the `on_http_request` phase, this action will remove the specified headers from incoming HTTP requests before reaching the upstream server.

### On `on_http_response`

When executed during the `on_http_response`, the configured headers are removed from HTTP responses returned from the upstream server before reaching the client.

### Removal Only

This action will only remove headers from the request or response.

- If you want to add a header use the [`add-headers`](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/add-headers) action.
- If you want to replace a header, first use this action _then_ use the [`add-headers`](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/add-headers) action.

### Ordering

Since actions are run in the order they are specified, to modify headers that have been added by other actions you must place this action
after them in your traffic policy document.

### Special Cases

- You may not add or remove the `user-agent` header.
