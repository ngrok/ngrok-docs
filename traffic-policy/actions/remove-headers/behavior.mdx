## Behavior

When executed as an inbound policy, this action will remove headers on an incoming http request before reaching the upstream server with
the configured headers. When executed as an outbound policy, the configured headers are removed to the response from the upstream server.

### Removal Only

This action will only remove headers from the request or response.

- If you want to add a header use the [`add-headers`](/docs/http/traffic-policy/actions/add-headers) action.
- If you want to replace a header, first use this action _then_ use the [`add-headers`](/docs/http/traffic-policy/actions/add-headers) action.

### Ordering

Since actions are run in the order they are specified, to modify headers that have been added by other actions you must place this action
after them in your traffic policy document.

### Special Cases

- You may not add or remove the `user-agent` header.
