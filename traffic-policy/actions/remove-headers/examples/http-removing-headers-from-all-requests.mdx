### Removing headers from all requests

We have been getting a lot of requests with `x-client-version` and `x-trace-id`
and it is starting to overwhelm our logging system. We want to remove these headers
from all requests. The following example demonstrates how to remove these headers
using the `remove-headers` action.

#### Example Traffic Policy Document

<ConfigExample
	snippetText={null}
	showLineNumbers={true}
	jsonMetastring="{5-13}"
	yamlMetastring="{4-8}"
	config={{
		inbound: [
			{
				actions: [
					{
						type: "remove-headers",
						config: {
							headers: ["x-client-version", "x-trace-id"],
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>

For this example, we are assuming that ngrok is pointing at the upstream service
https://httpbin.org.

#### Example Request

```shell
$ curl -H "x-client-version: 3.1" -H "x-trace-id: abc123" https://httpbin.ngrok.app/get
< HTTP/2 200

{
...
  "headers": {
    "Date": "2024-06-24T15:30:00Z",
  }
...
}
```

In this example even though we sent the `x-client-version` and `x-trace-id` headers,
they were not present on the request that was sent upstream.
