## Behavior

If the specified `from` regular expression matches the request URL, the URL will
be modified according to the `to` field. If no `from` field is specified, the
entire URL will be treated as a match.

When a match is found and the request URL is modified by the `to` field, the
action will return a temporary `302` redirect by default, unless specified
otherwise through the `status_code` field.

If the request URL is not changed, the action will take no further action.

### CEL Interpolation

You can access Traffic Policy variables and embed CEL expressions in this
actions configuration values using CEL Interpolation in the form of
`${expression}`. Check out [the examples below](#examples) to see how
CEL Interpolation works.

**Note:** All CEL interpolation will occur **before** regular expressions
are evaluated.

For a complete list of variables and how to write expressions, see
[Expressions](/http/traffic-policy/expressions/variables/) and
[Variables](/http/traffic-policy/expressions/) documentation.
