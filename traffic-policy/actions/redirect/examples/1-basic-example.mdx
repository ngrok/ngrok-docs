### Redirect using Paths

The following [Traffic Policy](/docs/http/traffic-policy/)
configuration demonstrates how to use the `redirect` action to redirect incoming
requests from `/products` to `/store/products`.

#### Example Traffic Policy Document

<ConfigExample
	snippetText={null}
	showLineNumbers={true}
	jsonMetastring="{5-12}"
	yamlMetastring="{4-13}"
	config={{
		on_http_request: [
			{
				actions: [
					{
						type: "redirect",
						config: {
							from: "/products",
							to: "/store/products",
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>

This configuration will redirect any request from `/products` to `/store/products`
with the default `302 Found` status code.

#### Example Request

```shell
$ curl -i https://example.ngrok.app/products
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
location: https://example.ngrok.app/store/products
```

In this example, a request to `/products` will be redirected to `/store/products`
with a `302 Found` status code, and the `Location` header will indicate the new
URL.
