sidebarTitle: Add Headers
description: Add headers to an HTTP request or response before it is delivered upstream or back to the client.

import { ConfigField } from "/snippets/ConfigTable.jsx";
import ActionVariablesDescription from "/snippets/traffic-policy/common/action-variables-description.mdx";

The Add Headers action enables you to add custom headers to an HTTP request or
response before delivery to the upstream service or client. This is useful
for attaching metadata like request identifiers, applying security controls, or
adjusting how applications process traffic.

## Configuration Reference

The [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/) configuration reference for this action.

### Supported Phases

`on_http_request`, `on_http_response`

### Type

`add-headers`

### Configuration Fields

<ConfigField title="headers" type="object" cel={true}>
  Map of header key to header value to be added.

Minimum `1`, Maximum `10`.

</ConfigField>

## Behavior

When configured in the `on_http_request` phase, this action will add the specified headers to incoming http requests before reaching the upstream server. When
configured in the `on_http_response` phase, the specified headers are added to the http response from the upstream server.

### Addition Only

This action will only add headers to the request or response. If the header already exists
it will append another header with the same key unless it is the `host` header,
see [Special Cases](#special-cases).

To replace or remove headers use the [`remove-headers`](/traffic-policy/actions/remove-headers) action then
add the header with the desired value.

### Case Sensitivity

Header keys added through this action are normalized to lowercase per the [HTTP/2 specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7540#section-8.1.2).

### Ordering

Since actions are run in the order they are specified, to modify headers that have been added by other actions you must place this action
after them in your traffic policy document.

### Special Cases

- Adding the `host` header override the existing value instead of appending another header.
- You may not add or remove the `user-agent` header.
- You may not use this action to add the `ngrok-skip-browser-warning` header to skip the ngrok browser warning on free accounts. For more information, check out the [free plan limits guide](/pricing-limits/free-plan-limits#removing-the-interstitial-page).

## Examples

### Adding Client IP Headers to all HTTP requests

The following [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/)
configuration will add the client IP address to all HTTP requests.

#### Example Traffic Policy Document

<CodeGroup>
```yaml policy.yml
on_http_request:
  - actions:
    - type: "add-headers"
      config:
        headers:
          x-client-ip: "${conn.client_ip}"
```
```json policy.json
{
  "on_http_request": [
    {
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "add-headers",
          "config": {
            "headers": {
              "x-client-ip": "${conn.client_ip}"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
</CodeGroup>

For this example, we are assuming that ngrok is pointing at the upstream service
https://httpbin.org and we are adding the following header to all requests:

- `x-client-ip` with the value `${conn.client_ip}` to demonstrate the use of
  CEL interpolation to include the client IP address.

#### Example Request

```bash
$ curl -i https://httpbin.ngrok.app/get
```

```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
content-type: application/json

{
  "headers": {
    "X-Client-Ip": "2600:1700:4fa6:1a00:2051:938:7373:5563",
  }
}
```

### Adding headers to an HTTP response

The following [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/)
configuration will add headers to the response from the upstream service when the method is `GET` and the URL starts with `/status/200`.

#### Example Traffic Policy Document

<CodeGroup>
```yaml policy.yml highlight={3}
on_http_response:
  - expressions:
      - "req.method == "GET" && req.url.path.startsWith("/status/200")"
    actions:
      - type: "add-headers"
        config:
          headers:
            x-custom-header: "my-custom-value"
            x-string-interpolation-example: "started at ${conn.ts.start}"
```
```json policy.json highlight={5}
{
  "on_http_response": [
    {
      "expressions": [
        "req.method == \"GET\" && req.url.path.startsWith(\"/status/200\")"
      ],
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "add-headers",
          "config": {
            "headers": {
              "x-custom-header": "my-custom-value",
              "x-string-interpolation-example": "started at ${conn.ts.start}"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
</CodeGroup>

For this example, we are assuming that ngrok is pointing at the upstream service
https://httpbin.org and we will be adding two headers:

- `x-custom-header` with the value `my-custom-value`
- `x-string-interpolation-example` with the value `started at ${conn.ts.start}`
  to demonstrate the use of CEL interpolation to include the request connection
  start time.

### Example Request

```bash
$ curl -i https://httpbin.ngrok.app/status/200
```

```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
x-custom-header: my-custom-value
x-string-interpolation-example: started at 2024-07-13T00:10:16Z
```
