The **Rate Limit** Traffic Policy action enables you to configure thresholds
that restrict the throughput of traffic that successfully reaches your endpoint.

Traffic may be limited overall or by attributes of the incoming requests.

## Configuration Reference

The [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/) configuration
reference for this action.

### Supported Phases

`on_http_request`

### Type

`rate-limit`

### Configuration Fields

    <ConfigField title="name" type="string" required={true}>
        <p>A name for this rate limit configuration. Must be less than <code>1024</code> characters.</p>
    </ConfigField>

    <ConfigField title="enforce" type="boolean" required={false}>
        <p>Controls whether the rate limit is actively applied at runtime. When enabled, requests exceeding the limit are blocked or throttled as configured. When disabled, the system evaluates the rate limit but does not enforce it, allowing you to test configurations, gather metrics, or return a custom response.</p>
        <p>The default value is <code>true</code>.</p>
    </ConfigField>

    <ConfigField title="algorithm" type="enum" required={true}>
        <p>The rate limit algorithm to be used.</p>
        <ConfigEnum label="Supported values">
            <ConfigEnumOption>`sliding_window`</ConfigEnumOption>
        </ConfigEnum>
    </ConfigField>

    <ConfigField title="capacity" type="integer" required={true}>
        <p>The maximum number of requests allowed to reach your upstream server.</p>
        <p>The minimum capacity is <code>1</code> and the maximum capacity is <code>2,000,000,000</code>.</p>
    </ConfigField>

    <ConfigField title="rate" type="string" required={true}>
        <p>The duration in which events may be limited based on the current capacity. Must be specified as a time duration that is a multiple of ten seconds (for example, <code>"90s"</code>, <code>"10m"</code>).</p>
        <p>The minimum value is <code>"60s"</code> and the maximum value is <code>"24h"</code>.</p>
    </ConfigField>

    <ConfigField title="bucket_key" type="array of strings" required={true}>
        <p>The elements of this collection define the unique key of a request to track the rate at which the capacity is being met.</p>
        <p>Each bucket key is a CEL expression which includes all valid traffic policy [variables](/traffic-policy/variables/) and [macros](/traffic-policy/macros/).</p>
        <ConfigEnum label="Sample buckets">
            <ConfigEnumOption>`req.host` - The Host of the request.</ConfigEnumOption>
            <ConfigEnumOption>`conn.client_ip` - The client IP address.</ConfigEnumOption>
            <ConfigEnumOption>`getReqHeader('X-Example-Header-Name')` - The value for the specified header key, if it exists.</ConfigEnumOption>
        </ConfigEnum>
        <p>Up to ten bucket keys can be specified. For multiple buckets, the action will rate limit by each unique combination of buckets.</p>
    </ConfigField>

## Behavior

### Determining the Rate Limit Bucket

When this action is executed, information from the incoming HTTP request is
used to determine which rate limit bucket the request falls into. Each bucket
is defined by specific criteria through the `bucket_key` configuration field
such as client IP, request host, or a header value.

If the bucket has not exceeded its capacity, the request proceeds to the next
action in your policy configuration.

## Multiple Buckets

If multiple `bucket_key` values are specified, the action will create a
unique rate limit bucket for each combination of the specified keys. For
example, if you have two `bucket_key` values, such as `req.host` and `conn.client_ip`,
all incoming requests that have the exact same combination of `Host` header and client IP
will be grouped into the same rate limit bucket. To rate limit separately with two different
buckets, you can create multiple `rate-limit` actions instead.

### Rate Limit Exceeded

If the identified bucket has received more events than its capacity over the
specified duration:

1. The request is rejected with an `HTTP 429â€”Too Many Requests` status code.
2. The `retry-after` header is included in the response, indicating the number
   of seconds after which the request may be retried.

### Capacity per Ingress Server

Currently, the `capacity` for each rate limit bucket is applied per ingress
server. This means that each server independently tracks the number of requests
and enforces the rate limits accordingly.


## Examples
### Rate Limit by Host Header

The following [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/)
configuration demonstrates how to use the `rate-limit` action to rate limit
all incoming requests by the `Host` header.

#### Example Traffic Policy Document

<CodeGroup>
```yaml policy.yml {10}
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: rate-limit
        config:
          name: Only allow 30 requests per minute
          algorithm: sliding_window
          capacity: 30
          rate: 60s
          bucket_key:
            - 'hasReqHeader(''host'') ? getReqHeader(''host'')[0] : ''unknown'''
```

```json policy.json {13}
{
  "on_http_request": [
    {
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "rate-limit",
          "config": {
            "name": "Only allow 30 requests per minute",
            "algorithm": "sliding_window",
            "capacity": 30,
            "rate": "60s",
            "bucket_key": [
              "hasReqHeader('host') ? getReqHeader('host')[0] : 'unknown'"
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
</CodeGroup>

For this example, we are assuming that ngrok is pointing at the upstream service
https://httpbin.org.

#### Example Request

```bash
$ curl https://httpbin.ngrok.app/get
```

```http
HTTP/2 429
retry-after: 24
```

In this example, we attempt to connect to `httpbin.ngrok.app` using the `curl`
command and get back a `429` status code with a `retry-after` header telling us
the number of seconds we must wait before retrying the request.
