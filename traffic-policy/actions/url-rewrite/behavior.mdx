## Behavior

This action replaces all matches of the`from` regular expression in the request
URL with the`to` replacement value.

### Matching

Matching is done against the full URL, including the scheme, userinfo, host, and
port, not just the path.

To match requests that start with `/products` you must use
[CEL Interpolation](#cel-interpolation) and write
`^${req.url.authority}/products` or use an expression like
`req.url.path.startsWith('/products')` in the policy rule `expressions` field.

### CEL Interpolation

You can access Traffic Policy variables and embed CEL expressions in this
actions configuration values using CEL Interpolation in the form of
`${expression}`. Check out [the examples below](#examples) to see how
CEL Interpolation works.

**Note:** All CEL Interpolation will occur **before** regular expressions
are evaluated.

For a complete list of variables and how to write expressions, see
[Expressions](/http/traffic-policy/expressions/variables/) and
[Variables](/http/traffic-policy/expressions/) documentation.
