## Behavior

This action replaces all occurrences of the `from` regular expression in the request URL with the `to` replacement value.

### Matching

Matching is performed against the entire URL, including the scheme, userinfo, host, and port, not just the path.

To match requests that begin with `/products`, use [CEL Interpolation](/docs/traffic-policy/concepts/cel-interpolation) and write `^${req.url.authority}/products`, or use an expression like `req.url.path.startsWith('/products')` in the phase rule's `expressions` field.

### Note about CEL Interpolation

All CEL Interpolation will occur **before** regular expressions
are evaluated.
