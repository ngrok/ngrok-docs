### Rewrite using CEL Interpolation

The following [Traffic Policy](/docs/http/traffic-policy/)
configuration demonstrates how to use the `url-rewrite` action to transparently
rewrite the request URL from `/products/*` to `/products.php` using a global
policy rule (no expression) by leveraging [CEL Interpolation](#cel-interpolation).

#### Example Traffic Policy Document

<ConfigExample
	snippetText={null}
	showLineNumbers={true}
	jsonMetastring="{5,8-14}"
	yamlMetastring="{4-13}"
	config={{
		inbound: [
			{
				actions: [
					{
						type: "url-rewrite",
						config: {
							from: "${req.url.authority}/products/?([.*]+)?",
							to: "/products.php?query=$1",
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>

This configuration will rewrite any request urls that start with `/products/*`
to `/products.php?query=$1` without changing the URL seen by the client. It does
this by leveraging [CEL Interpolation](#cel-interpolation) to replace the
`from` value with the request URL authority. This is useful for hiding away the
underlying implementation details of your service.

#### Example Request

```shell
$ curl -i https://example.ngrok.app/products/123
```

```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
```

##### Example Server Logs

```http
GET /product.php?query=123          200 OK
```

#### Conclusion

In this example, a request to `/products` is internally routed to
`/products.php?query=123`, and the response is served from `products.php` while
the client remains unaware of the URL rewrite.
