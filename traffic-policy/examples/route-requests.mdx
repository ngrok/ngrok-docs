With Traffic Policy, you can use [CEL interpolation](/traffic-policy/concepts/cel-interpolation) to dynamically forward requests to different internal endpoints based on URL request attributes, including but not limited to:

- URL
- hostname
- path
- headers

This allows you to manage complex traffic topologies without manually creating and managing each [`forward-internal` action](/traffic-policy/actions/forward-internal).

This page contains examples of rules that route requests based on different request attributes.

See [the `forward-internal` Traffic Policy action docs](/traffic-policy/actions/forward-internal/) for more information.

## Based on URL

This rule forwards requests from `https://*.example.com` to `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.internal`.

<CodeGroup>

```yaml policy.yml
on_http_request:
  -     name: Route requests based on URL
    actions:
      -         type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: https://${req.host.split(".example.com")[0]}.internal
```

```json policy.json
{
  "on_http_request": [
    {
      "name": "Route requests based on URL",
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "forward-internal",
          "config": {
            "url": "https://${req.host.split(\".example.com\")[0]}.internal"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Based on headers

This rule forwards requests containing a `X-Customer-Value: {CUSTOMER}` header to `https://{CUSTOMER}.internal`.

<CodeGroup>

```yaml policy.yml
on_http_request:
  actions:
    -       type: forward-internal
      config:
        url: https://${getReqHeader('X-Customer-Value')[0]}.internal
```

```json policy.json
{
  "on_http_request": {
    "actions": [
      {
        "type": "forward-internal",
        "config": {
          "url": "https://${getReqHeader('X-Customer-Value')[0]}.internal"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
