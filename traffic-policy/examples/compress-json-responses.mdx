description: Learn how to compress JSON responses using Traffic Policy to improve performance and reduce bandwidth usage.

With Traffic Policy, you can ensure all JSON responses returned by your upstream services are [compressed](/traffic-policy/actions/compress-response) en route to the API consumer.

This rule compresses JSON responses using the `gzip`, `br`, `deflate`, and `compress` algorithms.

<Note>  If your upstream service already handles compression, ngrok skips this step.

```yaml policy.yml
on_http_response:
- name: Add compression
actions:
- type: compress-response
    config:
      algorithms:
- gzip
- br
- deflate
- compress
```

```json policy.json
{
  "on_http_response": [
    {
      "name": "Add compression",
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "compress-response",
          "config": {
            "algorithms": ["gzip", "br", "deflate", "compress"]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
