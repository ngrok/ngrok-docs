description: Learn how to enforce minimum TLS version requirements using Traffic Policy to reject connections using outdated TLS versions.
---

With Traffic Policy, you can prevent obsolete and potentially vulnerable browsers, SDKs, or CLI tools like `curl` from attempting to access your API.

This rule:

1. Uses [the `conn.tls.version` connection variable](/traffic-policy/variables/connection/#conntlsversion) to check the incoming request's TLS version.
1. Rejects versions below `1.3` with a `401 Unauthorized` response.

<CodeGroup>

```yaml policy.yml
on_http_request:
- name: Reject requests using old TLS versions
  expressions:
  - conn.tls.version < '1.3'
  actions:
  - type: custom-response
    config:
      status_code: 401
      body: 'Unauthorized: TLS version too old'
```

```json policy.json
{
  "on_http_request": [
    {
      "name": "Reject requests using old TLS versions",
      "expressions": [
        "conn.tls.version < '1.3'"
      ],
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "custom-response",
          "config": {
            "status_code": 401,
            "body": "Unauthorized: TLS version too old"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
