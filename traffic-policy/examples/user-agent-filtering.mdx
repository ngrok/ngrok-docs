With Traffic Policy, we automatically parse out useful information from the request's `User-Agent` header and make them [available as variables](/traffic-policy/variables/req/#requser_agentname). You can use them to deliver tailored content to users based on their browser and device, or to customize or block for SEO crawlers and bots.

This rule delivers tailored content to Microsoft Edge users by matching on the `req.user_agent.name` value.

<CodeGroup>

```yaml policy.yml
on_http_request:
  -     expressions:
      - req.user_agent.name == 'Edge'
    actions:
      -         type: custom-response
        config:
          status_code: 200
          body: Hello Edge User!
```

```json policy.json
{
  "on_http_request": [
    {
      "expressions": [
        "req.user_agent.name == 'Edge'"
      ],
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "custom-response",
          "config": {
            "status_code": 200,
            "body": "Hello Edge User!"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

You can also quickly block bots from your site by denying them by user-agent using the handy boolean flag.

<CodeGroup>

```yaml policy.yml
on_http_request:
  -     expressions:
      - req.user_agent.is_bot
    actions:
      -         type: deny
        config:
          status_code: 403
```

```json policy.json
{
  "on_http_request": [
    {
      "expressions": [
        "req.user_agent.is_bot"
      ],
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "deny",
          "config": {
            "status_code": 403
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
