With Traffic Policy, you can block unwanted requests to your endpoints. This page demonstrates a few example rules that do so.

See the following Traffic Policy action docs for more information:

- [`deny`](/traffic-policy/actions/deny/)
- [`custom-response`](/traffic-policy/actions/custom-response/)

## How to deny traffic from Tor

This rule uses the [connection variables](/traffic-policy/variables/connection/) available in [IP Intelligence](/traffic-policy/variables/ip-intel) to block [Tor](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(network)>) exit node IPs.

<CodeGroup>

```yaml policy.yml
on_http_request:
  - expressions:
      - ('proxy.anonymous.tor' in conn.client_ip.categories)
    actions:
      - type: deny
        config:
          status_code: 403
```

```json policy.json
{
  "on_http_request": [
    {
      "expressions": [
        "('proxy.anonymous.tor' in conn.client_ip.categories)"
      ],
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "deny",
          "config": {
            "status_code": 403
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## How to deny traffic from bots and crawlers with a `robots.txt`

This rule returns a custom response with a [`robots.txt` file](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots/intro) to deny search engine or [AI crawlers](https://platform.openai.com/docs/bots/) on all paths.

<CodeGroup>

```yaml policy.yml
on_http_request:
  - name: Add `robots.txt` to deny all bots and crawlers
    expressions:
      - req.url.contains('/robots.txt')
    actions:
      - type: custom-response
        config:
          status_code: 200
          body: User-agent: *
Disallow: /
          headers:
            content-type: text/plain
```

```json policy.json
{
  "on_http_request": [
    {
      "name": "Add `robots.txt` to deny all bots and crawlers",
      "expressions": [
        "req.url.contains('/robots.txt')"
      ],
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "custom-response",
          "config": {
            "status_code": 200,
            "body": "User-agent: *\r\nDisallow: /",
            "headers": {
              "content-type": "text/plain"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

You can extend this example to create specific rules for crawlers based on their user agent strings, like [`ChatGPT-User` and `GPTBot`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/bots).

<CodeGroup>

```yaml policy.yml
on_http_request:
  - name: Add `robots.txt` to deny specific bots and crawlers
    expressions:
      - req.url.contains('/robots.txt')
    actions:
      - type: custom-response
        config:
          status_code: 200
          body: User-agent: ChatGPT-User\r\nDisallow: /
          headers:
            content-type: text/plain
```

```json policy.json
{
  "on_http_request": [
    {
      "name": "Add `robots.txt` to deny specific bots and crawlers",
      "expressions": [
        "req.url.contains('/robots.txt')"
      ],
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "custom-response",
          "config": {
            "status_code": 200,
            "body": "User-agent: ChatGPT-User\\r\\nDisallow: /",
            "headers": {
              "content-type": "text/plain"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## How to block traffic from bots and crawlers by user agent

You can also take action on incoming requests that contain specific strings in [the `req.user_agent` request variable](/traffic-policy/variables/req/#requser-agent).

<CodeGroup>

```yaml policy.yml
on_http_request:
  - name: Block specific bots by user agent
    expressions:
      - req.user_agent.name in ['ChatGPT-User', 'GPTBot', 'OAI-SearchBot']
    actions:
      - type: deny
        config:
          status_code: 404
```

```json policy.json
{
  "on_http_request": [
    {
      "name": "Block specific bots by user agent",
      "expressions": [
        "req.user_agent.name in ['ChatGPT-User', 'GPTBot', 'OAI-SearchBot']"
      ],
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "deny",
          "config": {
            "status_code": 404
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>

You can expand the expression to include additional user agents by adding them to the list:

```bash
['ChatGPT-User', 'GPTBot', 'anthropic', 'claude']
```

</Tip>

## How to block traffic from bots and crawlers by IP Address

You can also use IP Intelligence variables to block AI Bots by IP Address.

<BlockAIBotsByIPIntel />

## Deny non-GET requests

This rule denies all inbound traffic that is not a GET request.

<CodeGroup>

```yaml policy.yml
on_http_request:
  - expressions:
      - req.method != 'GET'
    actions:
      - type: deny
```

```json policy.json
{
  "on_http_request": [
    {
      "expressions": [
        "req.method != 'GET'"
      ],
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "deny"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Custom response for unauthorized requests

This rule sends a custom response with status code `401` and body `Unauthorized` for requests without an Authorization header.

<CodeGroup>

```yaml policy.yml
on_http_request:
  - expressions:
      - !('authorization' in req.headers)
    actions:
      - type: custom-response
        config:
          status_code: 401
          body: Unauthorized
```

```json policy.json
{
  "on_http_request": [
    {
      "expressions": [
        "!('authorization' in req.headers)"
      ],
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "custom-response",
          "config": {
            "status_code": 401,
            "body": "Unauthorized"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## How to block traffic from specific countries

Sometimes you may need to block requests originating from one or more countries to remain compliant with data regulations or sanctions. This rule blocks requests based on the origin country using [ISO country codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes) with the following steps:

1. Check if the request is from an array of countries you can define
1. If so, return a `401` status code with an error message.

<CodeGroup>

```yaml policy.yml
on_http_request:
  - expressions:
      - conn.geo.country_code in ['<COUNTRY-01>', '<COUNTRY-02>']
    name: Block traffic from unwanted countries
    actions:
      - type: custom-response
        config:
          status_code: 401
          body: Unauthorized request due to country of origin.
```

```json policy.json
{
  "on_http_request": [
    {
      "expressions": [
        "conn.geo.country_code in ['<COUNTRY-01>', '<COUNTRY-02>']"
      ],
      "name": "Block traffic from unwanted countries",
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "custom-response",
          "config": {
            "status_code": 401,
            "body": "Unauthorized request due to country of origin."
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Limit request sizes

This rule demonstrates how to prevent excessively large user uploads, like text or images, that might cause performance or availability issues for your upstream service with the following steps:

1. Check if the request is `POST` or `PUT
1. Check if the request's content is 1MB or larger.
1. If both conditions are met, return a `400` status code with an error message.

<CodeGroup>

```yaml policy.yml
on_http_request:
  - name: Block large POST/PUT requests.
    expressions:
      - req.method == 'POST' || req.method == 'PUT'
      - req.content_length >= 1000
    actions:
      - type: custom-response
        config:
          status_code: 400
          body: Error: You can't upload content larger than 1MB.
```

```json policy.json
{
  "on_http_request": [
    {
      "name": "Block large POST/PUT requests.",
      "expressions": [
        "req.method == 'POST' || req.method == 'PUT'",
        "req.content_length >= 1000"
      ],
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "custom-response",
          "config": {
            "status_code": 400,
            "body": "Error: You can't upload content larger than 1MB."
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Exempt specific traffic from rate limits

In this example, the Algolia web crawler is exempted from any rate limiting configured on your site. See [the IP Intelligence docs](/traffic-policy/variables/ip-intel/#ip-categories) for other bots and crawlers that are available.

<CodeGroup>

```yaml policy.yml
on_http_request:
  - expressions:
      - !('com.algolia.crawler' in conn.client_ip.categories)
    actions:
      - type: rate-limit
        config:
          name: Only allow 30 requests per minute
          algorithm: sliding_window
          capacity: 30
          rate: 60s
          bucket_key:
            - conn.client_ip
```

```json policy.json
{
  "on_http_request": [
    {
      "expressions": [
        "!('com.algolia.crawler' in conn.client_ip.categories)"
      ],
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "rate-limit",
          "config": {
            "name": "Only allow 30 requests per minute",
            "algorithm": "sliding_window",
            "capacity": 30,
            "rate": "60s",
            "bucket_key": [
              "conn.client_ip"
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
