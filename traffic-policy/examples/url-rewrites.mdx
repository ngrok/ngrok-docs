description: Learn how to rewrite URLs using Traffic Policy to map user-friendly URLs to backend permalinks for better SEO and user experience.
---


With Traffic Policy, you can map permalinks to "pretty" alternatives that are easier for both humans and [SEO bots](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/googlebot) to understand.
This is especially useful for blogs that use a CMS, since the generated permalinks might be affecting your SEO performance.

This rule rewrites a user-friendly URL like `/blog/11/example-title` to `/blog/index.php?p=11&title=example-title`, which is readable by your CMS.

```yaml policy.yml
on_http_request:
- expressions:
- req.url.path.startsWith('/blog')
actions:
- type: url-rewrite
    config:
      from: "/blog/([0-9]+)/([a-zA-Z]+)/"
      to: "/blog/index.php?p=$1&title=$2"
```

```json policy.json
{
  "on_http_request": [
    {
      "expressions": ["req.url.path.startsWith('/blog')"],
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "url-rewrite",
          "config": {
            "from": "/blog/([0-9]+)/([a-zA-Z]+)/",
            "to": "/blog/index.php?p=$1&title=$2"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
