description: Learn how to run A/B tests using Traffic Policy by routing traffic to different endpoints based on random distribution.
---


With at least two endpoints and Traffic Policy, you can run simple A/B tests with using the [`rand.double()` macro](/traffic-policy/macros/#randdouble---double).

## Basic example

This rule:

1. Uses `rand.double()` to generate a random `double` between 0 and 1 when traffic reaches the endpoint
1. Checks if the value is less than or equal to 0.5
1. If so, it routes the traffic to a different [internal Agent Endpoint](/universal-gateway/internal-endpoints/).

<CodeGroup>

```yaml policy.yml
on_http_request:
- expressions:
- rand.double() <= 0.5
actions:
- type: forward-internal
    config:
      url: https://a.internal
- actions:
- type: forward-internal
    config:
      url: https://b.internal
```

```json policy.json
{
  "on_http_request": [
    {
      "expressions": ["rand.double() <= 0.5"],
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "forward-internal",
          "config": {
            "url": "https://a.internal"
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "forward-internal",
          "config": {
            "url": "https://b.internal"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
  
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  You can change the value the random number is checked against to split the traffic in different ratios.
  For example,`>=0.8` would send 80% of the traffic to one endpoint and 20% to the other.
</Tip>

See [the `forward-internal` Traffic Policy action docs](/traffic-policy/actions/forward-internal/) for more information.

## Using rewrites

You can also send the traffic to a different route using URL rewrites.

<CodeGroup>

```yaml policy.yml
on_http_request:
- expressions:
- rand.double() <= 0.5
actions:
- type: url-rewrite
    config:
      from: "/path/to/test"
      to: "/path/to/test-b"
- actions:
- type: forward-internal
    config:
      url: https://b.internal
```

```json policy.json
{
  "on_http_request": [
    {
      "expressions": ["rand.double() <= 0.5"],
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "url-rewrite",
          "config": {
            "from": "/path/to/test",
            "to": "/path/to/test-b"
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "forward-internal",
          "config": {
            "url": "https://b.internal"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
  
</CodeGroup>

See [the URL Rewrite Example](/traffic-policy/examples/url-rewrites) for another example using rewrites.
