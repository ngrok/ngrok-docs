The documentation is written in Markdown and organized into directories by topic.

Once you have finished making your changes, we recommend you run a local build with docusaurus (command `pnpm run build`) to ensure your contribution will not present errors with links or build. After a successful build, push them to your fork on GitHub and create a pull request to submit your changes for review.
