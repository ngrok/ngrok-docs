description: Learn about ngrok's secure tunnel agent for exposing local services, connecting devices, and creating secure remote access.
---

The ngrok agent is a lightweight command-line program that creates secure tunnels from ngrok's global network to your local services, devices, and applications.
It enables you to expose services behind firewalls and NATs, connect remote devices, and create secure site-to-site connectivity without complex network configuration.

- It runs as a standalone executable with zero runtime dependencies on all major operating systems.
- It supports HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, and TLS protocols for any application or service.
- You can run multiple endpoints simultaneously and manage them via configuration files or the CLI.
- You can install it as a native OS service for automatic startup, crash recovery, and background operation.

## Concepts

Here are the core elements you should familiarize yourself with to make the most of ngrok's secure tunnels:

## Features

Here are the primary capabilities of ngrok's secure tunnel agent:

- [Support for multiple protocols](/agent/) - Create HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, and TLS endpoints for any application or service.
- [Background service](/agent/#running-ngrok-in-the-background) - Install as a native OS service with automatic startup and crash recovery.
- [Remote management](/agent/#remote-management) - Stop, restart, or upgrade agents remotely via API or dashboard.
- [Custom connect URLs](/agent/connect-url/) - Brand your agent connections with custom domains for white-label deployments.
- [API integration](/agent/cli-api/) - Built-in CLI for the ngrok API to manage endpoints, domains, and resources programmatically.
