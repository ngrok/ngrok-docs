### Message

Your `PRODUCT` version "`VERSION`" is too old. The minimum supported agent version for your account is "`MINVERSION`". Update to a newer version with 'ngrok update', by downloading from https://ngrok.com/download, or by updating your SDK version. Paid accounts are currently excluded from minimum agent version requirements. To begin handling traffic immediately without updating your agent, upgrade to a paid plan: https://dashboard.ngrok.com/billing/choose-a-plan.
