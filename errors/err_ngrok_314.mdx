### Message

Only paid plans may create endpoints with custom hostnames.
Failed to create an endpoint with the custom hostname `HOSTNAME` for the account `ACCOUNT`.
This account is on the `PLAN` plan.

Upgrade to a paid plan at: https://dashboard.ngrok.com/billing/choose-a-plan

### Possible Solutions

- Upgrade your account to a Pro or Pay-as-you-go plan from your [account dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/billing/plan) in order to reserve a custom hostname.

<Tip>
	If you don't need a fully-custom hostname, you can reserve a custom ngrok
	domain (like `example.ngrok.app`) on our paid plans.
