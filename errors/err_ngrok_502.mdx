## Message

Your account is limited to `MAX` reserved addresses. If you need more addresses, you can upgrade to a Pay-as-you-go plan at: https://dashboard.ngrok.com/billing/choose-a-plan?plan=paygo.

### Additional Info

ngrok resource limits are per-user, not per-account. For example, an account with 3 users will have its limits multiplied by 3.

### Possible Solutions

- You can [invite more users to join your ngrok account](/iam/users/#invitations).
- If you need a more scalable option, consider a signing up for a [pay-as-you-go plan](https://ngrok.com/pricing).
