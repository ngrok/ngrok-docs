### Message

Failed to create an endpoint with the domain `DOMAIN`. Nested subdomains of an ngrok base domain `ENDPOINT_DOMAIN` must be reserved first. Alternatively, try `SUGGESTION` instead.

### Possible solutions

- Reserve your subdomain [in the dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains) before starting a tunnel with it.
