## Message
The wildcard `DOMAIN` is proxied by Cloudflare. While the wildcard's covered subdomains resolve to Cloudflare's edge and may be working correctly, we cannot verify the wildcard CNAME. If you're experiencing issues with this wildcard domain, try disabling the Cloudflare proxy on the `DOMAIN` record and verify again.
