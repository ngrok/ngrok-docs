### Message

The endpoint `URL` is already online. Either

1. stop your existing endpoint first, or
2. start both endpoints with `--pooling-enabled` to load balance between them.

### Additional Information

You can only use a tunnel URL for one tunnel session at a time. This error occurs when an ngrok tunnel with the requested URL is already online.

This error also appears if you attempt to create multiple tunnels using the same hostname.

- You can [view tunnel status from your dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/endpoints).
- You can also [view actively connected agents from your dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/agents). Select one from the list to view any tunnels that agent is handling.

### Possible Solutions

- Stop the tunnel that is currently running in order to make your desired URL available.
- Choose a different unique URL or hostname to start your tunnel.
