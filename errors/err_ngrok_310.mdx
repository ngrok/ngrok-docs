## Message
Only Hobbyist and Pay-as-you-go plans may create endpoints with reserved addresses.
Failed to create an endpoint with the address `ADDR` for the account `ACCOUNT`.
This account is on the `PLAN` plan.

This usually only happens if you downgraded your ngrok account and it no
longer has permission to use reserved addresses.

Upgrade your account at: https://dashboard.ngrok.com/billing/choose-a-plan
