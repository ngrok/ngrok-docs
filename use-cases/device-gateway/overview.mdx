description: Use ngrok as a device gateway to securely connect, manage, and control IoT devices and remote systems.
---

ngrok's device gateway lets you securely connect to IoT devices and remote systems without exposing them to the public internet.

- Connect to devices behind NAT, firewalls, or CGNAT without opening inbound ports.
- Manage device access centrally with Cloud Endpoints and Traffic Policy.
- Start and stop tunnels on-demand using the ngrok agent API.
- Deploy a single agent per site to reach all devices on the local network.

## Concepts

<Columns cols={1}>
	<Card title="Internal Endpoints" href="/universal-gateway/internal-endpoints/" horizontal>
		Private endpoints that expose device services inside ngrok's network without public access.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Cloud Endpoints" href="/universal-gateway/cloud-endpoints/" horizontal>
		Permanent, externally accessible entry points that route traffic to internal endpoints.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Agent API" href="/agent/api/" horizontal>
		Programmatically start, stop, and manage tunnels on running ngrok agents.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Service Users" href="/iam/service-users/" horizontal>
		Create dedicated authtokens for each device or site, independent of user accounts.
	</Card>

## What's next?

- Follow the [Remote IoT Devices guide](/guides/device-gateway/agent/) to set up your device gateway.
- Use the [Python SDK](/guides/device-gateway/sdk/) to embed connectivity directly into your application.
- Explore [installation guides](/guides/device-gateway/linux/) for deploying ngrok on different platforms.
