description: Use ngrok as a device gateway to securely connect, manage, and control IoT devices and remote systems.
---

ngrok's device gateway lets you securely connect to IoT devices and remote systems without exposing them to the public internet.

- Connect to devices behind NAT, firewalls, or CGNAT without opening inbound ports.
- Manage device access centrally with Cloud Endpoints and Traffic Policy.
- Start and stop tunnels on-demand using the ngrok agent API.
- Deploy a single agent per site to reach all devices on the local network.

## Concepts

	<Card title="Internal Endpoints" href="/universal-gateway/internal-endpoints/" horizontal>
		Private endpoints that expose device services inside ngrok's network without public access.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Cloud Endpoints" href="/universal-gateway/cloud-endpoints/" horizontal>
		Permanent, externally accessible entry points that route traffic to internal endpoints.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Agent SDKs" href="/agent-sdks/" horizontal>
		Embed ngrok connectivity directly into your application with native SDKs.
