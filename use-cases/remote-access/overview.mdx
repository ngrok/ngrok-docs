description: Use ngrok for secure remote access to devices and servers via SSH, RDP, and other protocols.
---

ngrok enables secure remote access to devices and servers without exposing them directly to the internet.

- Access devices behind NAT, firewalls, or CGNAT via SSH or RDP.
- Create TCP endpoints for any protocol without opening inbound ports.
- Centralize access control with Cloud Endpoints and Traffic Policy.
- Deploy a single agent per network to reach all devices on the local network.

## Concepts

	<Card title="TCP Endpoints" href="/universal-gateway/tcp/" horizontal>
		Create secure TCP connections for SSH, RDP, databases, and other non-HTTP protocols.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Internal Endpoints" href="/universal-gateway/internal-endpoints/" horizontal>
		Private endpoints that expose device services inside ngrok's network without public access.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Cloud Endpoints" href="/universal-gateway/cloud-endpoints/" horizontal>
		Permanent, externally accessible entry points that route traffic to internal endpoints.

	<Card title="IP Restrictions" href="/traffic-policy/actions/restrict-ips/" horizontal>
		Whitelist source IPs to control who can access your remote devices.

## What's next?

- Follow the [SSH & RDP guide](/use-cases/remote-access/ssh-rdp/) to set up remote access.
- Learn about [IP restrictions](/traffic-policy/actions/restrict-ips/) to secure your endpoints.
- Explore [endpoint pooling](/universal-gateway/endpoint-pooling/) for high availability.
