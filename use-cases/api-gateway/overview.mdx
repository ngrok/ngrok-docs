description: Use ngrok as an API gateway to deliver, secure, and manage traffic to your APIs running anywhere.
---

ngrok's API gateway lets you centralize traffic management for all your APIs in one place—no matter where they run.

- Route traffic to upstream services based on path, headers, or any request property.
- Authenticate requests with JWT validation, OAuth, OIDC, or API keys.
- Apply rate limiting, IP restrictions, and WAF rules to protect your APIs.
- Observe all requests from a single dashboard with [Traffic Inspector](/obs/traffic-inspection/).

## Concepts

<Columns cols={1}>
	<Card title="Cloud Endpoints" href="/universal-gateway/cloud-endpoints/" horizontal>
		Always-on, public-facing endpoints where you centrally manage traffic policy and route requests to your upstream services.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Internal Endpoints" href="/universal-gateway/internal-endpoints/" horizontal>
		Private endpoints for your upstream API services that receive traffic forwarded from Cloud Endpoints.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Traffic Policy" href="/traffic-policy/" horizontal>
		Rules you attach to endpoints to authenticate, rate limit, transform, and route traffic.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Forward Internal" href="/traffic-policy/actions/forward-internal/" horizontal>
		The action that routes traffic from your public Cloud Endpoint to internal Agent Endpoints.
	</Card>
</Columns>

## Use cases

<Columns cols={2}>
	<Card
		title="Route to upstream services"
		icon="arrow-right"
		href="/traffic-policy/actions/forward-internal/"
	>
		Forward traffic from your public endpoint to internal services running anywhere.
	</Card>
	<Card
		title="Load balance across clouds"
		icon="cloud"
		href="/guides/api-gateway/multicloud/"
	>
		Distribute traffic across API services running in multiple clouds or regions.
	</Card>
	<Card
		title="Validate JWTs"
		icon="key"
		href="/traffic-policy/actions/jwt-validation/"
	>
		Authenticate all API requests by validating JWT tokens from any OAuth provider.
	</Card>
	<Card
		title="Rate limit APIs"
		icon="gauge"
		href="/traffic-policy/actions/rate-limit/"
	>
		Protect your services from abuse by limiting requests per IP, API key, or custom bucket.
	</Card>
</Columns>
