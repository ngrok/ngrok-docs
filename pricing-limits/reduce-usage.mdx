## Enable compression

## Block unwanted requests

You can use Traffic Policy to block unwanted traffic, reducing your bandwidth usage on ngrok. Prime candidates for blocking might include bots, crawlers, malicious IPs, or requests from specific geographic regions.

The following example demonstrates using the [`deny`](/traffic-policy/actions/deny/) Traffic Policy action to block requests from [Tor exit nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(network)), but you can also block requests based on IP address, user agent, geographic location, and more.

```yaml
on_http_request:
  - expressions:
      - ('proxy.anonymous.tor' in conn.client_ip.categories)
    actions:
      - type: deny
        config:
          status_code: 403
```

For more examples, see the [Block Unwanted Requests](/traffic-policy/examples/block-unwanted-requests/) guide.

## Use caching headers in the client
