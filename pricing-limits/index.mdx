<Note>
You can check your usage [in the ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/billing).
</Note>

### Refreshing limits

Your usage refreshes on the first day of each month.

### Endpoint limits

Your endpoint limit is based on the number of unique host-port combinations you have created. You cannot have more than one of these combinations in use simultaneously.

<Warning>
This limit does not refresh at the end of each calendar month.
</Warning>

## Wildcard endpoints

Wildcard endpoints allow you to create a single endpoint that receives traffic for all subdomains matching a wildcard domain pattern, such as `*.example.com`. 
For example, if you create the wildcard endpoint `https://*.example.com`, it will receive traffic for `https://foo.example.com`, `https://bar.example.com`, and any other matching subdomains.

### Billing for wildcard endpoints

For any wildcard endpoint you create, you will be charged **one endpoint hour** for the wildcard endpoint itself, regardless of how many subdomains match the wildcard pattern or how many internal endpoints the wildcard endpoint forwards traffic to.

### Wildcard Cloud Endpoints forwarding to internal endpoints

When you use a wildcard Cloud Endpoint that forwards traffic to multiple internal endpoints using Traffic Policy actions (such as the `forward-internal` action), billing works as follows:

- **Endpoint hours**: You are charged one endpoint hour for the wildcard Cloud Endpoint. The internal endpoints that receive forwarded traffic do not incur additional endpoint hour charges, as they are internal-only endpoints.

- **Traffic Policy (TP)**: Traffic Policy actions executed on the wildcard Cloud Endpoint are charged according to standard [Traffic Policy Unit (TPU) pricing](/pricing-limits/traffic-policy-unit-pricing/). This includes any actions used to route or forward traffic to internal endpoints.

- **Individual endpoints vs. wildcard endpoints**: If you create individual endpoints for specific subdomains (for example, `https://api1.example.com` and `https://api2.example.com`) instead of using a wildcard endpoint, each individual endpoint or wildcard endpoint will be charged separately for endpoint hours.

For more information on creating and using wildcard endpoints, see the [wildcard endpoints documentation](/universal-gateway/http/#wildcard-endpoints).

## Pay-as-you-go FAQs

### What is the Pay-as-you-go plan?

The Pay-as-you-go plan is a flexible pricing model that allows you to pay only for the resources you use, without any upfront commitment. It is ideal for production workloads that require scalability and flexibility.

### How does the Pay-as-you-go plan work?

You are charged based on your actual usage of ngrok resources, such as data transfer, endpoints, and connections. There are no fixed monthly fees, and you can scale your usage up or down as needed.

### Why are there two invoices for each billing cycle?

The Pay-as-you-go plan generates two invoices: one for the base fee and another for the usage-based charges. This allows you to see your fixed costs separately from your variable costs.
