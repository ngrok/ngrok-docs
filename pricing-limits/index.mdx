<Note>
You can check your usage [in the ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/billing).
</Note>

### Refreshing limits

Your usage refreshes on the first day of each month.

### Endpoint limits

Your endpoint limit is based on the number of unique host-port combinations you have created. You cannot have more than one of these combinations in use simultaneously.

<Warning>
This limit does not refresh at the end of each calendar month.
</Warning>

## Wildcard and Subdomain Usage

When reserving a wildcard domain on the paid plans, subdomains are counted towards your usage. For example, if you reserve `*.example.com`, `sub1.example.com` and `sub2.example.com` are counted as two subdomains.
You will be charged for each subdomain you use.

## Pay-as-you-go FAQs

- **What is the Pay-as-you-go plan?**
  - The Pay-as-you-go plan is a flexible pricing model that allows you to pay only for the resources you use, without any upfront commitment. It is ideal for production workloads that require scalability and flexibility.
- **How does the Pay-as-you-go plan work?**
  - You are charged based on your actual usage of ngrok resources, such as data transfer, endpoints, and connections. There are no fixed monthly fees, and you can scale your usage up or down as needed.
- **Why am I seeing two invoices for each billing cycle?**
  - The Pay-as-you-go plan generates two invoices: one for the base fee and another for the usage-based charges. This allows you to see your fixed costs separately from your variable costs.
