description: Connect to your local PostgreSQL database remotely using ngrok TCP endpoints on port 5432.
---


This guide walks you through connecting to your local PostgreSQL database remotely using ngrok TCP endpoints.

## What you'll need

- PostgreSQL installed and running locally.
- An ngrok account.
- Your ngrok authtoken.
- A valid payment method added to your account (TCP endpoints are only available on a free plan after adding a valid payment method).

## Expose your PostgreSQL database

After installing the database, you can connect to it using a standard ngrok TCP endpoint sending traffic to port `5432`.

```bash
ngrok tcp 5432
```

## Connect to your database

Once ngrok is forwarding traffic to your PostgreSQL service, you can use the TCP address provided to connect to it remotely.

```bash
psql -h 0.tcp.ngrok.io -p 12345 -U postgres -d postgres
```
