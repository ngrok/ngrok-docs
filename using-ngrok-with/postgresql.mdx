After installing the database, you can connect to it using a standard ngrok TCP endpoint sending traffic to port `5432`.

```bash
ngrok tcp 5432
```

<Warning>
	TCP endpoints are only available on a free plan after [adding a valid payment
	method](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/settings#id-verification) to your account.
</Warning>

Once ngrok is forwarding traffic to your PostgreSQL service, you can use the TCP address provided to connect to it remotely.

```bash
psql -h 0.tcp.ngrok.io -p 12345 -U postgres -d postgres
```
