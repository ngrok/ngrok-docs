### ngrok Agent

To share a local Flask development server with someone else, simply run: `ngrok http 5000`.

You may also need to update your [`SERVER_NAME`](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/config/#SERVER_NAME) and [`APPLICATION_ROOT`](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/config/#APPLICATION_ROOT) in your Flask app configuration to the values provided by ngrok. See the [Flask docs](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/config/#builtin-configuration-values) for more information.

Note: For users on the latest MacOS, there is an issue where the default port 5000 (and 7000) is used by Apple AirPlay Receiver. You can use a different port for your Flask app or disable the Apple AirPlay receiver by disabling it in `System Settings > General > AirDrop & Handoff > AirPlay Receiver`.

### Python SDK

You can also use the [ngrok Python SDK](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-python) to start an endpoint to the Flask dev server via [python code](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-python#frameworks), or using a [ngrok ASGI runner](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-python#asgi-runner---tunnels-to-uvicorn-gunicorn-django-and-more-with-no-code) with an [ASGI Wrapper](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/deploying/asgi/).
