As noted in this [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/59716766/17282727), you can use a TCP endpoint to host your local MongoDB server. Open an ngrok TCP endpoint to your local MongoDB service which is usually running on port `27017`.

```bash
ngrok tcp 27017
```

<Warning>
	TCP endpoints are only available on a free plan after [adding a valid payment
	method](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/settings#id-verification) to your account.
</Warning>
