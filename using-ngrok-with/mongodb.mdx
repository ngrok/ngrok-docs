This guide explains how to expose your local MongoDB server using ngrok TCP endpoints.

## What you'll need

- MongoDB installed and running locally.
- An ngrok account.
- Your ngrok authtoken.
- A valid payment method added to your account (TCP endpoints are only available on a free plan after adding a valid payment method).

## Expose your MongoDB server

Use a TCP endpoint to expose your local MongoDB server.
Open an ngrok TCP endpoint to your local MongoDB service, which is usually running on port `27017`.

```bash
ngrok tcp 27017
```

## Connect to your database

Once ngrok is forwarding traffic to your MongoDB service, use the TCP address and port from the ngrok output to connect from your preferred client.
