This guide covers exposing your local MongoDB server to the internet using ngrok TCP endpoints.

## What you'll need

- MongoDB installed and running locally.
- An ngrok account.
- Your ngrok authtoken.
- A valid payment method added to your account (TCP endpoints are only available on a free plan after adding a valid payment method).

## Expose your MongoDB server

As noted in [this Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/59716766/17282727), you can use a TCP endpoint to host your local MongoDB server.
Open an ngrok TCP endpoint to your local MongoDB service, which is usually running on port `27017`.

```bash
ngrok tcp 27017
```
