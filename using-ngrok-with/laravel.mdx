This guide explains how to use ngrok with Laravel Valet to share your local Laravel development sites with others.

ngrok is built into Laravel Valet.
To learn more about using your existing ngrok account with Laravel, see the Laravel Valet documentation.

```bash
valet set-ngrok-token YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

Replace `YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` with your [ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
