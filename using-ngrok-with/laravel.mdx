## What you'll need

- Laravel Valet installed.
- Your [ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).

## Set your ngrok authtoken

ngrok is built into Laravel Valet.
To learn more about using your existing ngrok account with Laravel, see the Laravel Valet documentation.
