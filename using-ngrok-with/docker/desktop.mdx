The ngrok Docker Desktop Extension allows you to use ngrok's API Gateway cloud service to forward traffic from internet-accessible endpoint URLs to your local Docker containers.

The extension provides tools to:

- Create and manage endpoints
- Apply Traffic Policy
- Configure custom URLs and endpoint binding type
- Enable endpoint pooling for load balancing scenarios

## Installation

Click [here](https://open.docker.com/extensions/marketplace?extensionId=ngrok/ngrok-docker-extension) to add the ngrok extension to Docker Desktop.

## Quick Start

1. After installing the extension, you will be prompted to add your [ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
2. Start an endpoint by clicking `+` icon on the container you want to put online.
3. Optionally specify a custom URL and [traffic policy](https://ngrok.com/docs/traffic-policy/).
4. You have an endpoint URL for your container you can share!

## Video Demo - Using ngrok with Docker Desktop

We'll demonstrate the ngrok Docker extension by walking through its core capabilities using n8n and Ollama containers as examples. You'll see how the extension integrates seamlessly into Docker Desktop's interface, automatically detecting all running containers and letting you create public URLs with a single click.
