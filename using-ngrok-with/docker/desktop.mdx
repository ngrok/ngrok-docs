The ngrok Docker Desktop Extension allows you to use ngrok's API Gateway cloud service to forward traffic from internet-accessible endpoint URLs to your local Docker containers.

The extension provides tools to:

- Create and manage endpoints
- Apply Traffic Policy
- Configure custom URLs and endpoint binding type
- Enable endpoint pooling for load balancing scenarios

## Installation

Click [here](https://open.docker.com/extensions/marketplace?extensionId=ngrok/ngrok-docker-extension) to add the ngrok extension to Docker Desktop.

## Quick start

1. After installing the extension, you will be prompted to add your [ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
2. Start an endpoint by clicking `+` icon on the container you want to put online.
3. Optionally specify a custom URL and [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/).

You now have an endpoint URL for your container that you can share.
