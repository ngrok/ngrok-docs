This guide explains how to tunnel an OpenVPN server through CGNAT using an ngrok TCP endpoint on port `443`.
It covers starting the endpoint, downloading your `.ovpn` profile, and updating it to use the ngrok TCP address and port.

For a detailed community walkthrough, see [Tunneling an OpenVPN server out from behind CGNAT](https://forums.openvpn.net/viewtopic.php?p=116476#p116476).

## What you'll need

- An OpenVPN server running behind CGNAT.
- OpenVPN Connect installed.
- [ngrok](https://download.ngrok.com) installed.
- Your [ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).

## 1. Start a TCP endpoint on port 443

Open a TCP endpoint to port `443`:

```bash
ngrok tcp 443
```

<Warning>  TCP endpoints are only available on a free plan after [adding a valid payment method](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/settings#id-verification) to your account.
</Warning>

## 2. Download your OpenVPN profile

Open the TCP address shown in the ngrok agent output in your browser.
Download the `.ovpn` profile you use with OpenVPN Connect.

## 3. Update the profile to use the ngrok port

Open the downloaded `.ovpn` file in a text editor.
Update the profile to use the TCP address and port shown by ngrok instead of `443`.

Import the updated profile into OpenVPN Connect.
You should be able to connect to your VPN as normal.
