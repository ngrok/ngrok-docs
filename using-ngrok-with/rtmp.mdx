---

This guide walks you through sharing your Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) streaming server using an ngrok TCP endpoint.

## Start a TCP endpoint

Start a TCP endpoint on port `1935` (the default RTMP port).

```bash
ngrok tcp 1935
```

## Use the endpoint in your RTMP configuration

Once the ngrok agent is running, use the TCP endpoint in your configuration where you would normally use the IP address.
For example:

```bash
rtmp://your-ngrok-tcp-address:ngrok-port/live/<some stream name>
```

<Note>
  Streaming data can use a lot of bandwidth quickly.
  If you're on a free plan, you may run into the [data transfer limits](../pricing-limits/free-plan-limits#limits-and-licensing) and need to upgrade to a paid plan.
