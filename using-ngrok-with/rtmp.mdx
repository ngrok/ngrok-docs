sidebarTitle: Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP)
---

Using ngrok to share your RTMP server is simple using TCP endpoints.

```bash
ngrok tcp 1935
```

Once the ngrok agent starts, you can use the TCP endpoint in your configuration where you would normally see the IP address. For example:

```bash
rtmp://your-ngrok-tcp-address:ngrok-port/live/<some stream name>
```

<Note>
	Streaming data can eat up a lot of bandwidth quickly. If you are on a free
	plan, you may run into the [data transfer
	limits](/pricing-limits/free-plan-limits#limits-and-licensing) and need to
	upgrade to a paid plan.
