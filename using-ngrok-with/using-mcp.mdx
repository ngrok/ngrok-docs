description: Learn how to use ngrok to proxy a local server so you can build custom apps for Claude's MCP.

[Claude.ai](https://www.anthropic.com/news/introducing-claude) supports [Custom MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integrations](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/11175166-about-custom-integrations-using-remote-mcp), allowing it to interact with your own tools and APIs via structured function calls.

That means you can bring any custom MCP server into Claude.ai or Claude Desktop, as long as it's reachable via a public endpoint.

Some of the smartest folks on the internet are already using ngrok to do this in seconds.

## Set up your local server with ngrok for MCP

Follow these steps to quickly test your local MCP server with Claude's MCP integrations:

### 1. Install ngrok

[Download and install](https://ngrok.com/download) the ngrok CLI.

**For macOS:**

```jsx
brew install ngrok
```

### 2. Connect ngrok to your account

Sign up for an account at [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/) and run:

```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN
```

### 3. Start your local MCP server

Make sure your MCP server is running on a specific port:

```bash
$ python mcp-server.py        # or whatever command runs your app

MCP Server Started. Now running on:

  http://localhost:3000
```

<Note>
	See [the Claude MCP](https://www.claudemcp.com/docs) documentation for more
	information on how to set up your local server.
</Note>

### 4. Expose your server with ngrok

Start an endpoint to forward traffic to your app:

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

Copy the HTTPS forwarding URL (for example, `https://abc123.ngrok.io`) which we will use in the next step.

### 5. Register your ngrok URL

Custom integrations using **Remote MCP** are now available on [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai/) and the Claude Desktop app for users on **Claude Max**, **Team**, and **Enterprise** plans. **This feature is currently in beta.**

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Claude Max">

1. Go to [**Settings → Profile**](https://claude.ai/settings/profile)
2. Scroll to the **Integrations** section
3. Click **Add more**
4. Paste the MCP server URL from your earlier step
5. Click **Add** to finish setting up the integration

</Tab>

Refer to Anthropic's official setup guide:

### 6. Test your integration

Send a message that requires MCP usage through Claude, you should now see requests live through ngrok to your locally running MCP server.

You'll see requests hitting your local server via ngrok.

## Restrict access to only Claude

Let's limit access to your MCP server only to Claude by only allowing the Anthropic IPs.

### 1. Create a Traffic Policy

Locally, save this file as `policy.yml`:

```bash
on_tcp_connect:
  - actions:
    - type: restrict-ips
      config:
        allow:
          - "160.79.104.0/23"
          - "2607:6bc0::/48"
```

### 2. Restart the agent

Then, restart your ngrok agent, but this time use:

```bash
ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file policy.yml
```

Your MCP server is now locked down to only accept requests from Anthropic's IP range.

While this significantly reduces risk, remember: **anyone with the URL can still add it to their account**, so be mindful of where and how you share it.
