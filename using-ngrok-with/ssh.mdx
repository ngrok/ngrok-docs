ngrok's TCP endpoints are perfect for SSH traffic. Simply start a TCP endpoint to port 22 and you should be all set.

```sh
ngrok tcp 22
```

<Warning>
	TCP endpoints are only available on a free plan after [adding a valid payment
	method](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/settings#id-verification) to your account.
</Warning>

When connecting through the ngrok TCP address, make sure you specify the port separately.

```sh
ssh -p PORT user@NGROK_TCP_ADDRESS
```

If you are getting any sort of failed connection, most of the time there is a misconfiguration with the server you are trying to connect to or the credentials you are using.
