description: Learn how to use ngrok TCP endpoints to access your local SSH server remotely on port 22 with proper port specification.
---

This guide shows you how to expose your local SSH server with an ngrok TCP endpoint and connect from a remote client.

## Expose your SSH server

ngrok's TCP endpoints work well for SSH traffic.
Start a TCP endpoint to port `22` and you're ready to connect.

```sh
ngrok tcp 22
```

<Warning>
  TCP endpoints are only available on a free plan after [adding a valid payment
  method](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/settings#id-verification) to your account.
</Warning>

## Connect via the ngrok TCP address

When connecting through the ngrok TCP address, specify the port separately.

```sh
ssh -p PORT user@NGROK_TCP_ADDRESS
```

If you're getting a failed connection, the cause is usually a misconfiguration on the server you're connecting to or the credentials you're using.
