description: Step-by-step guide for configuring GoDaddy DNS records to work with ngrok reserved domains using CNAME records.
---

This guide explains how to configure a custom domain in GoDaddy to work with ngrok.

<Note>
  GoDaddy does not support CNAMEs as apex records.
  An apex record is a DNS record at the root (or apex) of a DNS zone.
  For example, in the DNS zone `example.com`, an apex record also has the fully qualified name `example.com` (this is sometimes called a naked domain).
  By convention, the relative name `@` is used to represent apex records.
</Note>

## What you'll need

- A [custom domain added in ngrok](../universal-gateway/custom-domains/) with a subdomain (for example, `myapp.example.com`).
  GoDaddy requires a subdomain because it does not support CNAMEs as apex records.
- A GoDaddy account with a domain.

## 1. Find your reserved domain in ngrok

In your ngrok dashboard, go to [**Domains**](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains) and click the domain you want to use.
Click **DNS Targets**.
This provides you with the relevant CNAME values to use in later steps.

## 2. Access GoDaddy DNS management

Go to [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com) and log in with your credentials.
Click on your username in the upper right corner and select **My Products**.
Find your domain in the list and click **DNS** or **Manage DNS** next to it.

## 3. Add a CNAME record

In the DNS Management page, scroll down to the **Records** section.
Click **Add** to create a new record.
Select **CNAME** from the **Type** dropdown menu.
In the **Host** field, enter the subdomain you want to use (for example, `www` if your domain in ngrok is `www.example.com`).
In the **Points to** field, enter the CNAME provided by ngrok (for example, `ptenvq2ejdlptgyr.5mql8tts8aeqxhrtv.ngrok-cname.com`).
Set the TTL to your desired value (default is fine).
Click **Save** to add the record.

For more details, refer to [GoDaddy's guide on adding a CNAME record](https://www.godaddy.com/help/add-a-cname-record-19236).

## 4. Verify DNS status in ngrok

Once you've configured the DNS records in GoDaddy, return to the ngrok dashboard and click the **Check Status** button on the bottom of the DNS Details page.
It may take a few minutes to an hour for the DNS records to propagate. ngrok will continue to check at a regular interval.
Once you see a green checkmark, your domain is configured.

To use your new domain in the ngrok agent, add `--url your.domain.com` to the end of any command.
For example: `ngrok http 80 --url your.domain.com`.
