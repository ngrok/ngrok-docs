This guide explains how to connect to your local MySQL database remotely using ngrok TCP endpoints.

## What you'll need

- MySQL installed and running locally.
- An ngrok account.
- Your ngrok authtoken.
- A valid payment method added to your account (TCP endpoints are only available on a free plan after adding a valid payment method).

## Expose your MySQL database

To connect to a database using ngrok, you need to use a TCP endpoint.
Once you have your database up and running, you can remotely connect to it using an ngrok TCP endpoint and the default port of `3306`.

```bash
ngrok tcp 3306
```

## Connect to your database

Once ngrok is forwarding traffic, use the TCP address and port from the ngrok output to connect from your preferred MySQL client.
