description: Connect to your local MySQL database remotely using ngrok TCP endpoints on port 3306.
---

This guide covers connecting to your local MySQL database remotely using ngrok TCP endpoints.

## What you'll need

- MySQL installed and running locally.
- An ngrok account.
- Your ngrok authtoken.
- A valid payment method added to your account (TCP endpoints are only available on a free plan after adding a valid payment method).

## Expose your MySQL database

To connect to a database using ngrok, you need to use a TCP endpoint.
Once you have your database up and running, you can remotely connect to it using an ngrok TCP endpoint and the default port of `3306`.

```bash
ngrok tcp 3306
```

You can then use the ngrok TCP address and port for any tool that you'd like to use to remotely connect to your database.
