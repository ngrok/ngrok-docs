## Compatibility with FTP & FTPS

Because using FTP or FTPS (FTP over SSL) requires multiple dynamic ports for transferring data between server and client, ngrok is not a good solution for that traffic. We recommend using SFTP instead which relies on a single port number.

## ngrok with SFTP

You can use ngrok for SFTP communication by opening up a TCP endpoint on the port used by the SFTP server, usually port `22` (the same as SSH).

```bash
ngrok tcp 22
```

<Warning>
	TCP endpoints are only available on a free plan after [adding a valid payment
	method](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/settings#id-verification) to your account.
</Warning>

From there, you can use the resulting TCP address in your preferred SFTP client to connect to your local server.

## Alternatives to FTP for sharing files

If you're just looking for a quick and easy way to serve local files, ngrok has a [built in file server](/universal-gateway/http/#serving-file-directories).
