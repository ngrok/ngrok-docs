title: Install ngrok as a background service
description: Run ngrok as a native system service to ensure automatic startup and recovery from failures.
---

You can install ngrok in your customer's network as a native background system service. This ensures the ngrok agent starts on boot and that it will be restarted if it crashes for any reason. This helps ensure that you recover connectivity in the case of unexpected software or hardware failures. When you do so, ngrok will start all endpoints defined in the configuration file.

```bash
ngrok service install --config /etc/ngrok.yml
ngrok service start
```

<Note>
In most cases, installing ngrok as a service requires administrator privileges.
