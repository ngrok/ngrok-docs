You can install ngrok in your customer's network as a native background system service.
This ensures the ngrok agent starts on boot and restarts if it crashes for any reason.

Installing ngrok as a service helps you recover connectivity in the case of unexpected software or hardware failures.
When you do so, ngrok starts all endpoints defined in the configuration file.

```bash
ngrok service install --config /etc/ngrok.yml
ngrok service start
```

<Note>
In most cases, installing ngrok as a service requires administrator privileges.
