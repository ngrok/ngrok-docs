The ngrok agent is a standalone native executable with zero runtime dependencies.
It runs on all major operating systems and architectures, and is distributed through multiple channels to fit your deployment environment.

## Installing the ngrok agent

The ngrok agent is available on many platforms and through many popular package managers.
Visit the [ngrok download page](https://download.ngrok.com) for specific installation instructions based on your setup.

### Standalone binary

The ngrok agent is available as a standalone binary with no runtime dependencies.
Download it directly from the [ngrok download page](https://download.ngrok.com).

The agent supports the following platforms:

| OS | Supported architectures | | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | Windows | 64-bit, 32-bit (`x86-64`, `x86`) | | macOS | Intel, Apple Silicon (`x86-64`, `arm64`) | | Linux | `x86-64`, `x86`, `arm`, `arm64`, `mips`, `mips64`, `mips64le`, `mipsle`, `ppc64`, `ppc64le`, `s390x` | | FreeBSD | `x86-64`, `x86`, `arm` |

The agent can update itself with the [`ngrok update`](/agent/cli/#ngrok-update) command, even if you didn't install it with a package manager.

For more details, see the [Using ngrok with Docker](/using-ngrok-with/docker) documentation.

### Docker Desktop extension

The ngrok Docker Desktop Extension lets you forward traffic from internet-accessible endpoint URLs to your local Docker containers directly from the Docker Desktop UI.

[Install the ngrok Docker Desktop Extension](https://open.docker.com/extensions/marketplace?extensionId=ngrok/ngrok-docker-extension) to get started.

For more details, see the [Docker Desktop](/using-ngrok-with/docker/desktop) documentation.

## Kubernetes

The ngrok Kubernetes Operator lets you manage ngrok resources natively from within your Kubernetes cluster using Helm.

Install the Operator with Helm:

```bash
helm install ngrok-operator ngrok/ngrok-operator \
  --namespace ngrok-operator \
  --create-namespace \
  --set credentials.apiKey=$NGROK_API_KEY \
  --set credentials.authtoken=$NGROK_AUTHTOKEN
```

For more details, see the [Kubernetes Operator](/k8s/) documentation.
