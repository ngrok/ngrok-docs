When the ngrok agent starts, it makes an outbound connection via TLS over port 443 to the ngrok cloud service.
This connection is made to the "agent connect URL".

By default, [this connect URL](/agent/connect-url/) is `connect.ngrok-agent.com`, but you can white-label it so that your ngrok agents connect to `connect.acme.com` instead of the default connection hostname.
This is highly recommended because your customers may need to allowlist egress traffic out of their networks and they see this traffic in their network logs.
You can also request dedicated IPs for your connect URL that are unique to your account.

```bash
curl \
-X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Ngrok-Version: 2" \
-d '{"description":"Custom connect URL","domain":"connect.acme.com"}' \
https://api.ngrok.com/agent_ingresses
```

Once the custom connect URL has been created, specify this field within the agent configuration file:

```yaml
version: 3
agent:
  connect_url: connect.acme.com:443
```

## What's next

- [Install ngrok as a background service](/guides/site-to-site-connectivity/background-service) to ensure the agent starts on boot and recovers from failures.
