description: Learn how to use ngrok to remotely access APIs and DBs in your customer's network. Connect remotely without a VPN.
---

ngrok is a universal gateway, which means it allows you to connect to any app, IoT device, or service without networking expertise.

This guide will walk you through an example scenario using ngrok to set up secure, remote access to APIs and DBs running in your customer's on prem, private network. The solution will enable you to grant trusted parties access to critical systems without exposing those systems to the public internet or relying on complex VPN setups.

## Example scenario

Consider a situation where your company (Acme Corp.) needs direct access to resources running in your customer's private network. This network is a clinic that runs a third party API and a DB containing sensitive patient information. In this scenario, this clinic blocks inbound connections. However, your SaaS applications need to reach that API to make requests and fetch data from that DB for mission critical operations. Specifically, the patient DB needs to be e2e TLS encrypted, with mTLS terminating in the customer's network.

### Why only one ngrok Agent per network?

Traditionally, you might assume that every server inside the network needs its own ngrok agent, but this isn't necessary. A single ngrok agent is installed on a network-accessible machine inside the network. The agent acts as a central gateway (jumpbox) that can reach any machine on the local network, eliminating the need for multiple agents.

## Tutorial

### What you'll need

- An ngrok account. If you don't have one, [sign up](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup).
- An ngrok agent configured in a remote network. See the [getting started guide](/getting-started/) for instructions on how to install the ngrok agent.

### 1. Create a Service User and authtoken for isolated network access

First, you'll create a service user and an associated authtoken for each of your customers. A Service User is intended for automated systems that programmatically interact with your ngrok account (other platforms sometimes call this concept a Service Account). Create a separate Service User + associated authtoken for each of your customers so that:

1. Their usage of your ngrok account is isolated and scoped with a specific permission set
2. If a customer is compromised you can revoke their access independently
3. Agent start/stop audit events are properly attributed to each customer
4. Your ngrok agents don't stop working if the human user who set them up leaves your ngrok account.

Navigate to the [Service Users](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/service-users) section of your dashboard and click "new Service User".

Next, create an authtoken assigned to this specific bot user.

### 2. Install ngrok and configure Internal Endpoints

Configure the agent to create internal Agent Endpoints that point to the services you want to remotely access. This will connect the services to your ngrok account but nothing will be able to connect to them until completing the subsequent steps. The configuration to achieve this is shown below in the example agent configuration file.

Internal Endpoints are private endpoints that only receive traffic when forwarded through the [forward-internal Traffic Policy action](/traffic-policy/actions/forward-internal/). This allows you to route traffic to an application through ngrok without making it publicly addressable. Internal endpoint URL hostnames must end with `.internal`.

After installing the ngrok agent, define internal endpoints for each service you want to remotely access inside the ngrok configuration file. Additionally, here is where you'll configure the agent to terminate mTLS for the patient DB endpoint. You can install ngrok and its configuration file in `/path/to/ngrok/ngrok.yml` and the executable in `/path/to/ngrok/ngrok`.

```yaml
version: 3

agent:
  authtoken: AUTHTOKEN_CREATED_IN_STEP_1

endpoints:
  - name: Internal Endpoint for API
    url: https://api.internal
    upstream:
      url: 8080

  - name: Internal Endpoint for patient DB
    url: tls://patient-db.internal
    upstream:
      url: 8081
    agent_tls_termination:
      server_certificate: /path/to/your-cert.crt
      server_private_key: /path/to/your-key.key
      mutual_tls_certificate_authorities:
        - "list CAs here"
```

### 3. Create your Cloud Endpoints and attach a Traffic Policy

Cloud Endpoints are persistent, always-on endpoints whose creation, deletion, and configuration is managed centrally via the Dashboard or API. They exist permanently until they are explicitly deleted. Cloud Endpoints do not forward their traffic to an agent by default and instead only use their attached **Traffic Policy** to handle connections.

Create a public Cloud Endpoint in the ngrok dashboard by navigating to endpoints and clicking **new** as shown in the screenshot below:

![Screenshot showing how to create a new endpoint in the dashboard.](./img/Screenshot_2026-02-12_at_3.27.34_PM.png)

Additionally, create a Cloud Endpoint for the patient DB: `tls://db.acme.com`.

Click on your newly created API Cloud Endpoint and replace the default Traffic Policy with:

```yaml
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: https://api.internal
```

Click on your newly created DB Cloud Endpoint and replace the default Traffic Policy with:

```yaml
on_tcp_connect:
  - actions:
      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: tls://db.internal
```

### 4. Secure your API Cloud Endpoint with IP restrictions

Navigate to your newly created Cloud Endpoints in the [endpoints](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/endpoints) tab on your ngrok dashboard, and apply a Traffic Policy action to each. For this example, you can apply IP restrictions to your API endpoint. Browse through the full list of Traffic Policy actions listed [here](/traffic-policy/actions/). You can add this action directly to the Cloud Endpoint's YAML configuration. The final Traffic Policy config for each endpoint can be seen below:

**https://api.acme.com**

```yaml
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: restrict-ips
        config:
          enforce: true
          allow:
            - "allowed ips here (IPv4 or IPv6)"

      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: https://api.internal
```

Now that you have this Traffic Policy action in place, you have IP restrictions layered in front of your API endpoint, and your connection to the patient DB is end-to-end encrypted, with the ngrok agent validating mTLS.

## What's next

- [Set up a custom connect URL](/guides/site-to-site-connectivity/custom-connect-url) to white-label the agent connection for your customers.
- [Install ngrok as a background service](/guides/site-to-site-connectivity/background-service) to ensure the agent starts on boot and recovers from failures.
- [Eliminate single points of failure with redundant agents](/guides/site-to-site-connectivity/redundant-agents) to achieve high availability.
