description: Use ngrok to securely connect to APIs, databases, and services in remote private networks without a VPN.
---

ngrok helps you securely access APIs, databases, and other private services running in remote networks through [site-to-site connectivity](https://ngrok.com/use-cases/site-to-site-connectivity). This is useful for securely connecting to your customers' on-prem environments, branch offices, data centers, and more, all without opening inbound ports or managing VPN infrastructure.

You can run the ngrok agent inside remote networks, then [securely connect from your Kubernetes cluster](/guides/site-to-site-connectivity/customer-networks), enforce access control with IP restrictions, white-label connections with a custom connect URL, run redundant agents for high availability, and more.

## Why use ngrok for site-to-site connectivity?
