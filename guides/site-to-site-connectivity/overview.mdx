description: Use ngrok to securely connect to APIs, databases, and services in remote private networks without a VPN.
---

ngrok enables site-to-site connectivity by making it simple to securely connect to services running in remote private networks. This is useful for connecting to a customer's remote on-prem environments, branch offices, data centers, and more, without opening inbound ports or managing VPN infrastructure.

## Why use ngrok for site-to-site connectivity?

  <Card title="No inbound ports" icon="shield">
    The ngrok agent connects outbound over TLS on port 443. No firewall changes or open ports required in the remote network.

    Replace VPN tunnels, VPC peering, and custom networking with a single agent and a Cloud Endpoint.

    Support for TLS termination at the agent or upstream service, including mTLS for zero-knowledge encryption.
  </Card>

## How it works

1. You install the ngrok agent on a machine inside the remote network.
2. Using the agent, you create Internal Endpoints that point to local services, such as an API on port `8080`.
3. You create a Cloud Endpoint with a Traffic Policy that forwards traffic to those Internal Endpoints using the [`forward-internal`](/traffic-policy/actions/forward-internal/) action.
4. Requests to your Cloud Endpoint URL are routed through ngrok's cloud service to the agent, and then to the upstream service.

See [the quickstart](/guides/site-to-site-connectivity/quickstart) to try it out for yourself.

## What can you do?

| Use case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Access remote APIs** | Reach APIs running in customer or branch office networks without a VPN |
| **Connect to databases** | Query databases in private networks with end-to-end TLS encryption |
| **Enforce access control** | Apply IP restrictions, OAuth, JWT validation, or mTLS to your endpoints |
| **White-label connections** | Use a custom connect URL so customers see your brand in network logs |
| **High availability** | Run redundant agents with Endpoint Pooling for automatic failover |
| **Automated recovery** | Install ngrok as a system service so it starts on boot and restarts after crashes |
