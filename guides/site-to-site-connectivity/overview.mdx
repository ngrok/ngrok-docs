description: Use ngrok to securely connect to APIs, databases, and services in remote private networks without a VPN.
---

ngrok enables site-to-site connectivity by making it simple to securely reach APIs, databases, and services running in remote private networks. This is useful for securely connecting to your customers' on-prem environments, branch offices, data centers, and more, all without opening inbound ports or managing VPN infrastructure.

You can run the ngrok agent inside remote networks, then [securely connect from your Kubernetes cluster](/guides/site-to-site-connectivity/customer-networks), enforce access control with IP restrictions, white-label connections with a custom connect URL, run redundant agents for high availability, and more.

## Why use ngrok for site-to-site connectivity?

  <Card title="No inbound ports" icon="shield">
    The ngrok agent connects outbound over TLS on port 443. No firewall changes or open ports required in the remote network.

    Replace VPN tunnels, VPC peering, and custom networking with a single agent and a Cloud Endpoint.

## How it works

1. You install the ngrok agent on a machine inside the remote network.
2. Using the agent, you create Internal Endpoints that point to local services, such as an API on port `8080`.
3. You create a Cloud Endpoint with a Traffic Policy that forwards traffic to those Internal Endpoints using the [`forward-internal`](/traffic-policy/actions/forward-internal/) action.
4. Requests to your Cloud Endpoint URL are routed through ngrok's cloud service to the agent, and then to the upstream service.
