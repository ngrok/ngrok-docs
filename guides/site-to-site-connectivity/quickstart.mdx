description: Get a basic site-to-site connection working in minutes by forwarding traffic from a Cloud Endpoint to a service in a remote network.
---

This quickstart walks you through the fastest path to a working site-to-site connection using ngrok.
You'll learn how to:
- Configure an agent in a remote network
- Create a Cloud Endpoint
- Verify that traffic flows end-to-end

## What you'll need

- An [ngrok account](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup).
- The [ngrok agent](/getting-started/) installed on a machine inside the remote network you want to connect to.
- A service running in the remote network that you want to reach (this quickstart uses port `8080` as an example).

## 1. Configure an Internal Endpoint

First, open the ngrok configuration file on the remote machine and add an Internal Endpoint that points to the service you want to access.

You can do so by editing your config file with the `ngrok config edit` terminal command. Update yours to resemble the following snippet.

```yaml title="ngrok.yml" highlight={6-10}
version: 3

agent:
  authtoken: YOUR_AUTHTOKEN

endpoints:
  - name: my-service
    url: https://my-service.internal
    upstream:
      url: 8080
```

Replace `YOUR_AUTHTOKEN` with the authtoken from your [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).

Internal Endpoints are private endpoints that only receive traffic when a Cloud Endpoint forwards to them using the [forward-internal](/traffic-policy/actions/forward-internal/) Traffic Policy action.

Next, start the agent:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Using ngrok.yml">
  ```bash
  ngrok start --all
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Using a different config file">
  ```bash
  ngrok start --config /path/to/ngrok.yml --all
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Your services still can't be reached until you create a Cloud Endpoint to route traffic to it.

## 2. Create a Cloud Endpoint

Cloud Endpoints are persistent, always-on endpoints managed from the dashboard or API.
They use an attached Traffic Policy to handle incoming connections.

Navigate to [**Endpoints**](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/endpoints) in your ngrok dashboard, select **New**, and create your Cloud Endpoint.

After it's created, you'll be taken to the Traffic Policy editor view. Replace the default Traffic Policy with the following.

```yaml
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: https://my-service.internal
```

This routes all incoming traffic on the Cloud Endpoint to the Internal Endpoint you configured in step 1.

## 3. Test the connection

To verify that traffic reaches the service at your Internal Endpoint, visit your Cloud Endpoint URL, or send a curl request.

```bash
curl https://my-service.example.com
```

With this done, you have successfully configured site-to-site connectivity. You should see the response from the service running on port `8080` in the remote network.

## What's next

- [Configure site-to-site connectivity](/guides/site-to-site-connectivity/) for a full walkthrough with multiple endpoints, mTLS, and IP restrictions.
- [Set up a custom connect URL](/guides/site-to-site-connectivity/custom-connect-url) to white-label the agent connection for your customers.
- [Install ngrok as a background service](/guides/site-to-site-connectivity/background-service) so the agent starts on boot and recovers from failures.
- [Eliminate single points of failure](/guides/site-to-site-connectivity/redundant-agents) by running redundant agents for high availability.
- Create [Service Users](/iam/service-users/) to isolate and scope access per customer.
