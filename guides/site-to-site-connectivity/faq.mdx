## General

### How does site-to-site connectivity work with ngrok?

Your customer runs a lightweight ngrok agent inside their network that creates a secure, outbound TLS connection to the ngrok cloud service on port 443.
You create Cloud Endpoints that route traffic through that connection to the customer's internal services.
No inbound ports need to be opened in the customer's network.

### Do I need one agent per service in the customer's network?

No.
A single ngrok agent acts as a central gateway that can reach any service on the local network.
You configure multiple Internal Endpoints in the agent's configuration file, each pointing to a different upstream service.

### Does the customer need to make firewall changes?

No.
The ngrok agent connects outbound over TLS on port 443, which is typically already allowed.
No inbound firewall rules or open ports are required.

### Why use ngrok instead of a VPN or VPC peering?

Running an agent container is often more straightforward than configuring VPC peering.
The ngrok agent works the same way in any cloud, and any on-prem environment.
You don't need to reverse-engineer your customer's network or firewall configuration.

## Security

### How do I authenticate connections to customer services?

You can authorize connections from your cloud to ngrok using Traffic Policy.
With Traffic Policy, you can authenticate connections using [IP restrictions](/traffic-policy/actions/restrict-ips/), [JWT validation](/traffic-policy/actions/jwt-validation/), [OAuth](/traffic-policy/actions/oauth/), [OpenID Connect](/traffic-policy/actions/oidc/), [SAML](/traffic-policy/actions/saml/), and more.
Apply these as Traffic Policy actions on your Cloud Endpoints.

### Can I scope access to specific services?

Yes.
By default, you access only the specific APIs and databases at the ports associated with your Internal Endpoints.

### Is traffic end-to-end encrypted?

Yes, if you configure TLS termination at the ngrok agent or at the upstream service.
In these models, the ngrok cloud service only sees ciphertext.
See [TLS termination options](/universal-gateway/tls-termination/#end-to-end-encryption) for details.

### Can ngrok see the traffic it forwards?

No.
TLS terminates at the agent or upstream service.
In all encryption models, the ngrok agent itself cannot see the traffic it forwards.
See the [end customer guide](/guides/site-to-site-connectivity/end-customers#ngrok-traffic-encryption) for a full breakdown of the encryption models.

### How do I prevent unauthorized use of ngrok in the customer's network?

Set up a [custom connect URL](/guides/site-to-site-connectivity/custom-connect-url) so the agent connects to your branded domain (for example, `connect.acme.com:443`) instead of the default `connect.ngrok-agent.com`.
The customer can then block the default connect URL, preventing any other ngrok usage on their network.

### How do I lock down what agents can do?

Apply [Access Control Lists](/iam/rbac/#additional-restrictions-with-acls) (ACLs) to authtokens to restrict which endpoints an agent can create.
Since you can't fully trust agents running in a customer's network, ACLs lock them down to only create the endpoints you authorize.

### What compliance certifications does ngrok maintain?

ngrok complies with SOC 2 Type II, HIPAA (with BAA), GDPR, CCPA, and EU-US DPF. ngrok also supports RBAC, SSO with SCIM, audit logs, data residency controls, and white-labeling.
Visit the [Trust Center](https://trust.ngrok.com/) for reports and documentation.

## Reliability

### What happens if the agent loses its connection?

The ngrok agent sends a [heartbeat](/agent/#heartbeats) every 10 seconds.
If it doesn't receive a response within the tolerance window (15 seconds by default), it terminates the existing connection and automatically reconnects.
This allows site-to-site connectivity to recover after packet loss, dynamic IP changes, or complete network outages.

### How do I achieve high availability?

Run multiple agents in the customer's network with [Endpoint Pooling](/guides/site-to-site-connectivity/redundant-agents) enabled.
Connections are balanced across all healthy agents.
If one agent or its host machine fails, traffic is seamlessly routed to the remaining agents.

### Does ngrok stay online during region outages?

Yes.
Agents create secure connections to multiple [Points of Presence](/universal-gateway/points-of-presence/) in the ngrok cloud service.
If an entire data center fails, traffic automatically fails over to a healthy region.

### Can I monitor agent connectivity?

Yes.
You can publish tunnel status and connection events to your telemetry platform using ngrok's [event subscriptions](/obs/).
When a connection drops, you'll know before your customer does.

## Data residency

### Can I restrict traffic to specific regions?

Yes.
Configure the agent to connect to a PoP in one of the [supported regions](/universal-gateway/points-of-presence/), then set up DNS to route all connections through the same data plane.
Regional data planes are located in Australia (Sydney), Europe (Frankfurt), India (Mumbai), Japan (Tokyo), South America (São Paulo), and the United States (California and Ohio).

### Is ngrok multi-tenant?

Yes. ngrok is a multi-tenant application with services shared across the customer base.
If you need a dedicated instance, [inquire about ngrok's private edition](https://ngrok.com/contact).

## Deploying the Agent

### Where can the agent run?

The ngrok agent runs on Linux, Windows, and macOS across most CPU architectures.
It's also available as a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/ngrok/ngrok), [Kubernetes Operator](/k8s/), and [agent SDKs](/agent-sdks/) for Go, Python, JavaScript, and Rust.

### Can I embed the agent in my own application?

Yes.
Use the [agent SDKs](/agent-sdks/) to embed ngrok directly in your code.
This is useful when your software is already running in the customer's environment, like a bring-your-own-cloud deployment.

### How do I keep the agent running?

[Install ngrok as a system service](/guides/site-to-site-connectivity/background-service) so it starts on boot, automatically restarts after crashes, and sends logs to the system's native logging service.

### How do I update agents?

ngrok releases updates through all installation channels, but updates are not automatic.
Coordinate with your customer on when and how to update based on the deployment method.
See the [agent version support policy](/agent/version-support-policy/) for details.

### Can the Agent run in a DMZ?

Yes, as long as the systems in the DMZ meet the agent's [system requirements](/agent/#system-requirements) and the upstream service is also reachable from the DMZ.

## Branding and automation

### Can I white-label the connection?

Yes.
Use a [custom connect URL](/guides/site-to-site-connectivity/custom-connect-url) to brand the address the agent connects to with your own domain.
You can also use [custom domains](/universal-gateway/custom-domains/) for your Cloud Endpoint URLs and request dedicated IPs.

### Can I automate setup across customers?

Yes.
Every ngrok feature has a corresponding [API](/api-reference/) so you can automate provisioning across all your customers. ngrok also integrates with declarative IaC tools like [Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/ngrok/ngrok/latest/docs).

### How do I explain ngrok to my customers?

Share the [end customer guide](/guides/site-to-site-connectivity/end-customers) with your customers.
It covers what ngrok is, why it's being installed, how it works, security details, and operational considerations.
