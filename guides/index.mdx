Our guides walk you through concrete scenarios where you can successfully integrate ngrok into your workflow. Whether you need to create [ingress to remote Windows devices](/guides/device-gateway/windows), accept traffic from [behind a corporate firewall](/guides/running-behind-firewalls), or you just need [an ingress-as-a-service solution](/guides/identity-aware-proxy/securing-with-oauth), we have guides to help you get started.
