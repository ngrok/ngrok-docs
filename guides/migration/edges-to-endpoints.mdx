title: Migrating ngrok Edges to Cloud Endpoints
---


This guide walks you through manually migrating ngrok **Edge configurations** (HTTPS, TLS, TCP) to **Cloud Endpoints** using **Traffic Policies**.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- An **[ngrok account](https://dashboard.ngrok.com)** with an **[ngrok API key](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/api-keys)**.
- The [ngrok API documentation](/api).
- Tools like `curl` or Postman (or [ngrok's own API libraries](/api/#client-libraries)).
- Understanding of your existing **edge configurations**.
- YAML formatting skills for creating traffic policies.
- A text editor to prepare YAML payloads.

## ✅ What You'll Be Migrating

| Edge Type | Replaced By                     | Policy Phases Used                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| HTTPS     | Cloud Endpoint + Agent Endpoint | `on_http_request`, `on_http_response` |
| TLS/TCP   | Cloud Endpoint + Agent Endpoint | `on_tcp_connect`                      |

## ⚙️ 1. Set Up Environment

Make sure you have:

- **NGROK_API_TOKEN** (your personal or organization token).
- **API Base URL**: `https://api.ngrok.com`.

**Example Header for all API requests:**

```bash
Authorization: Bearer $NGROK_API_KEY
Ngrok-Version: 2
Content-Type: application/json
```

## 📋 2. List Your Edges

Use the ngrok API to list all existing edges:

```bash
GET /edges/https
GET /edges/tls
GET /edges/tcp
```

If a response includes a non-empty [`next_page_uri`](/api/#pagination) you’ll want to follow it until it is `null`:

```yaml
{
  "https_edges": [...],
  "next_page_uri": "/edges/https?page=2"
}
```

Just make sure to keep your [API rate limits](/api/#rate-limits) in mind! Repeat this process for:

- `/edges/tls`
- `/edges/tcp`

## 🧠 3. Determine the Target URL

Each edge has one or more `hostports`. Use those to define a **cloud endpoint `url`**:

| Edge Type | URL Format                   |
| --------- | ---------------------------- |
| HTTPS     | `https://yourdomain.com`     |
| TLS       | `tls://yourdomain.com:443`   |
| TCP       | `tcp://yourdomain.com:12345` |

Note, you’ll have to create a cloud endpoint for each `hostport` attached to an edge if you want multiple `hostports` to service the same traffic flow.

## 🛠️ 4. Create a Traffic Policy

Each cloud endpoint will have a YAML traffic policy.

Here is the base structure of a Traffic Policy:

```yaml
on_http_request: []
on_http_response: []
on_tcp_connect: []
```

Use only the relevant phases for the edge type.

## 🔁 5. Migrate Routes (HTTPS Only)

HTTPS edges have routes, and we will need to convert each route’s to a CEL expression based on it’s `match_type` for use on every rule that is defined.

Here are some example CEL expressions for routes based on the `match_type`:

| Match Type    | CEL Expression                    |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `exact_path`  | `req.url.path == "/foo"`          |
| `path_prefix` | `req.url.path.startsWith("/api")` |

Create these for later use in each `expressions:` block in your policy rules.

## 🔧 6. Convert Modules to Actions

Each module on the edge or its routes maps to one or more policy actions:

| Module                    | Actions                                                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `oauth`                   | `oauth` + `set-vars` + `custom-response` for restriction |
| `oidc`                    | `oidc` with optional auth_id + session durations         |
| `ip_restrictions`         | `restrict-ips`                                           |
| `request_headers`         | `add-headers`, `remove-headers`                          |
| `response_headers`        | `add-headers`, `remove-headers`                          |
| `circuit_breaker`         | `circuit-breaker`                                        |
| `webhook_verification`    | `verify-webhook`                                         |
| `compression`             | `compress-response`                                      |
| `user_agent_filter`       | `set-vars` + `deny` (based on user-agent match)          |
| `websocket_tcp_converter` | ⚠️ Not supported                                         |

You’ll want to translate each Module configuration to Action Configuration:

- [📚 Guide: How to Migrate Each Endpoint Configuration Module to Traffic Policy Actions](/guides/migration/modules-to-traffic-policy-actions)

Add these actions under the correct phase (with matching route expressions when the endpoint is HTTP or HTTPS).

## 🎯 7. Convert Backends

Your edge’s backend defines where traffic goes. These should be placed **after all other actions you defined above. These should be added to the end of the phase.**

### Tunnel Group Backends

If the edge uses a `tunnel_group` backend (identified by labels):

- Construct an internal domain for each label (e.g., `service=app` → `service-app.internal`)
- Forward traffic to each internal domain using the `forward-internal` action and fall through with the `forward-internal` action.
- Run the agent or create a cloud endpoint with that internal domain to receive traffic.

**Example Policy (HTTPS):**

```yaml
on_http_request:
  - expressions:
      - req.url.path.startsWith("/api")
    actions:
      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: https://service-app.internal
          on_error: continue
      - type: custom-response
        config:
          body: |
            No upstream tunnel available. Start your agent:
            ngrok http 80 --url https://service-app.internal
```

Here we are defining `forward-internal` to forward to [`https://service-app.internal`](https://service-app.internal) and when an error occurs (like the endpoint being offline) fallback to some custom text (by leveraging `on_error: continue` and `custom-response`) describing how to get back online (this is optional).

**Running internal agent endpoint via the CLI:**

```bash
ngrok http 80 --url https://service-app.internal
```

Here, we have started an agent endpoint with the URL [`https://service-app.internal`](https://service-app.internal) which points to a service running locally on the machine on port 80.

### TCP/TLS Backends

These are generally Tunnel Groups and should follow the same rules as above. However, wanted to call out that you should use the `on_tcp_connect` phase here instead:

```yaml
on_tcp_connect:
  - actions:
      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: tcp://app-service.internal:443

```

Additionally, you cannot use the `custom-response` action for an HTTP fallback.

### HTTP Response Backends

Use `custom-response` to serve static content:

```yaml
on_http_request:
  - expressions:
      - req.url.path.startsWith("/api")
    actions:
      - type: custom-response
        config:
          status_code: 200
          body: pong
```

### Failover Backends

1. Loop through the list of failover backends
2. For each backend type, applying the same rules in group in sequence but on each Tunnel Group, use `on_error: continue` to fall-through to the next group, or HTTP Response backend.

### Weighted Backends → Not yet supported

These are not officially supported today in traffic policies.

You can pseudo-replicate this functionality today using multiple internal endpoints and the `rand` macro to randomly send traffic:

```yaml
on_http_request:
  - expressions:
      - req.url.path.startsWith("/api")
    actions:
      - type: set-vars
        config:
          vars:
            - urls:
                - weight: 10
                  url: https://a.internal
                - weight: 20
                  url: https://b.internal
                - weight: 15
                  url: https://c.internal
                - weight: 5
                  url: https://d.internal
                - weight: 10
                  url: https://e.internal
                - weight: 8
                  url: https://f.internal
                - weight: 7
                  url: https://g.internal
                - weight: 12
                  url: https://h.internal
                - weight: 9
                  url: https://i.internal
                - weight: 4
                  url: https://j.internal
            - cumulative_weights: [10, 30, 45, 50, 60, 68, 75, 87, 96, 100]
            - weighted_chance: ${rand.int(0, 99)}
            - weighted_index: ${[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].filter(i, vars.cumulative_weights[i] > vars.weighted_chance)[0]}
            - weighted_url: ${vars.urls[vars.weighted_index].url}
  - expressions:
      - req.url.path.startsWith("/api")
    actions:
      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: ${vars.weighted_url}
          on_error: continue
      - type: custom-response
        config:
          body: |
            No upstream tunnel available. Start your agent:
            ngrok http 80 --url ${vars.weighted_url}
```

Since our CEL environment doesn’t support reduce or fold you’ll have to use an external script to determine the cumulative weights, chance, and lookups:

```python
import yaml

urls = [
  {"weight": 10, "url": "https://a.internal"},
  {"weight": 20, "url": "https://b.internal"},
  {"weight": 15, "url": "https://c.internal"},
  {"weight": 5,  "url": "https://d.internal"},
  {"weight": 10, "url": "https://e.internal"},
  {"weight": 8,  "url": "https://f.internal"},
  {"weight": 7,  "url": "https://g.internal"},
  {"weight": 12, "url": "https://h.internal"},
  {"weight": 9,  "url": "https://i.internal"},
  {"weight": 4,  "url": "https://j.internal"},
]

cumulative = []
total = 0
for u in urls:
  total += u["weight"]
  cumulative.append(total)

index_expr = "[{0}].filter(i, vars.cumulative_weights[i] > vars.weighted_chance)[0]".format(
  ', '.join(map(str, range(len(urls))))
)

config = {
  "type": "set-vars",
  "config": {
    "vars": [
      {"urls": urls},
      {"cumulative_weights": cumulative},
      {"weighted_chance": f"${{rand.int(0, {total - 1})}}"},
      {"weighted_index": f"${{{index_expr}}}"},
      {"weighted_url": "${vars.urls[vars.weighted_index].url}"}
    ]
  }
}

yaml_output = yaml.dump([config], sort_keys=False)
print(yaml_output)
```

## ✏️ 8. Create the Cloud Endpoint

Each edge `hostport` should become a separate **cloud endpoint** with its configuration represented as **JSON**, and the `traffic_policy` embedded as **stringified YAML**.

**Endpoint configuration object**

```json
{
  "type": "cloud",
  "url": "https://yourdomain.com",
  "description": "Migrated from edge abc123",
  "traffic_policy": "on_http_request:\n  - expressions:\n      - req.url.path.startsWith(\"/api\")\n    actions:\n      - type: oauth\n        config:\n          provider: google\n          client_id: ...\n      - type: forward-internal\n        config:\n          url: https://app-service.internal:443\non_http_response:\n  - actions:\n      - type: add-headers\n        config:\n          headers:\n            X-Edge: migrated\n"
}
```

> ⚠️ Ensure all newlines (\n) and indentations are preserved when stringifying YAML into JSON. It’s best to use a library or third-party service to stringify your YAML into an object and then generate the resulting cloud endpoint JSON object.

**Submit to:**

```bash
POST /endpoints
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer $NGROK_API_KEY
Ngrok-Version: 2

...
```

## 🧹 9. Clean Up the Old Edge

Once you have validated that your edge has been migrated and works, you can clean up the edge from your account:

```bash
DELETE /edges/{type}/{id}
```

Repeat for all HTTPS, TLS, and TCP edges.
