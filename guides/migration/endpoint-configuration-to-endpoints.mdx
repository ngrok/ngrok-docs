title: Migrate from ngrok Endpoint Configurations to Cloud Endpoints
---

## 🗑️ 6. Delete the Old Endpoint Configuration

Once the new endpoint is verified to work:

```bash
curl -X DELETE \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_NGROK_API_TOKEN" \
     -H "Ngrok-Version: 2" \
     https://api.ngrok.com/endpoint_configurations/YOUR_ENDPOINT_CONFIG_ID
```

## 🔁 Repeat for All Endpoint Configurations

Repeat **Steps 2-6** for every domain and address you have attached to the endpoint config.
Be careful if endpoints have multiple domains or addresses attached.

<Note>
	- **Dry Run First**: Test traffic policies without deleting anything. -
	**Backup Everything**: Save JSON exports of your current configurations. -
	**Check your protocols:** Not everything is supported on TCP / TLS.
</Note>

After completing the process, your endpoints will be managed under cloud endpoints with fine-grained traffic policies for better modular management and control.
