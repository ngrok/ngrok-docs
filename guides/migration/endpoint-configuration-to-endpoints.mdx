title: Migrate from ngrok Endpoint Configurations to Cloud Endpoints
---


## üóëÔ∏è 6. Delete the Old Endpoint Configuration

Once the new endpoint is verified to work:

```bash
curl -X DELETE \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_NGROK_API_TOKEN" \
     -H "Ngrok-Version: 2" \
     https://api.ngrok.com/endpoint_configurations/YOUR_ENDPOINT_CONFIG_ID
```

---

## üîÅ Repeat for All Endpoint Configurations

- Repeat **Steps 2‚Äì6** for every domain and address you have attached to the endpoint config.
- Be careful if endpoints have multiple domains/addresses attached.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Dry Run First**: Test traffic policies without deleting anything.
- **Backup Everything**: Save JSON exports of your current configurations.
- **Check your protocols!** Not everything is supported on TCP / TLS!

After completing the process, your endpoints will be managed under **cloud endpoints** with fine-grained **traffic policies**, allowing better modular management and control.
