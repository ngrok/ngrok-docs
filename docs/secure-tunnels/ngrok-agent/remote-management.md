# Remote Management
--------------------

The ngrok agent can be stopped, restarted, or upgraded remotely using the [Tunnel Sessions](/api/resources/tunnel-sessions#restart-tunnel-agent) API. You can also perform these actions from the ngrok Dashboard.

WARNING: Use this with caution if you have made changes to the config file. If for some reason ngrok cannot restart, you may lose access to the agent completely.
