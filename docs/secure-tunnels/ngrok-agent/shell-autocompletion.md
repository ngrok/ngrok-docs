# Shell Autocompletion
--------------------

Shell autocompletion for the ngrok agent makes it extremely easy to navigate all the command and flags by hitting tab in your terminal. It is available on Linux and MacOS operating systems and can be enabled for Bash or ZSH shells. See the [ngrok agent reference for the completion command](/secure-tunnels/ngrok-agent/reference/ngrok#ngrok-completion) for information on setting this up.
