# ngrok Agent
--------------------

The ngrok agent is usually installed on the same device where the service you are trying to tunnel is located (but it doesn't have to). Each agent leverages a Tunnel Authtoken Credential (tunnel credential in the API) to connect to the ngrok cloud and connect to a specific user account.

See our [ngrok agent reference](/docs/ngrok-agent) for a complete set of commands and examples.
