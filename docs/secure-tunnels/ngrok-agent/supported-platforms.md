# Installation and Supported Platforms

---

The ngrok agent runs on all major platforms including Linux, MacOS, Windows. For a full list of the platforms we support, please see our [ngrok agent download](https://ngrok.com/download) page.

If for some reason your platform is unsupported, you can still take advantage of the [SSH Reverse Tunnel Agent](/secure-tunnels/tunnels/ssh-reverse-tunnel-agent) since it only requires `ssh` to be installed.
