# ngrok Agent Configuration File
--------------------

For a full list of configuration options, see the [ngrok agent configuration reference documentation](/secure-tunnels/ngrok-agent/reference/config).

Sometimes your configuration for ngrok is too complex to be expressed in command line options or you need to open many tunnels at the same time. ngrok supports an optional YAML configuration file that provides you with the power to run multiple tunnels simultaneously as well as to tweak some of ngrok's more advanced settings.
