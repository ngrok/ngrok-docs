### Message
The authtoken you specified is properly formed, but it is invalid.
Your authtoken: <code>&lt;TOKEN&gt;</code>
This usually happens when:
    - You reset your authtoken
    - Your authtoken was for a team account that you were removed from
    - You are using ngrok link and this credential was explicitly revoked
Go to your ngrok dashboard and double check that your authtoken is correct:
