### Message
Endpoint configuration `&lt;ID&gt;`s HTTPS module terminates TLS which is incompatible with a 'tls' tunnel. You may either:
  - Modify the endpoint configuration to include the HTTPS module with 'terminate_tls' disabled.
  - OR start an 'http' tunnel with -bind-tls=true or -bind-tls=both instead
