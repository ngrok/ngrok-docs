### Message
Only Pro and Enterprise plans may bind reserved addresses.
Failed to bind the address <code>&lt;ADDR&gt;</code> for the account <code>&lt;ACCOUNT&gt;</code>.
This account is on the <code>&lt;PLAN&gt;</code> plan.

This usually only happens if you downgraded your ngrok.com account and it no
longer has permission to use reserved addresses.

Upgrade to Pro or Enterprise: https://dashboard.ngrok.com/billing/subscription
