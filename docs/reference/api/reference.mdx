| `maximum_duration` | uint32 | Integer number of seconds of the maximum duration of an authenticated session. After this period is exceeded, a user must reauthenticate. |
| `idp_metadata` | string | The full XML IdP EntityDescriptor. Your IdP may provide this to you as a a file to download or as a URL. |

| `allow_idp_initiated` | boolean | If true, the IdP may initiate a login directly (e.g. the user does not need to visit the endpoint first and then be redirected).

| `allow_idp_initiated` | boolean | If true, the IdP may initiate a login directly (e.g. the user does not need to visit the endpoint first and then be redirected).

| `allow_idp_initiated` | boolean | If true, the IdP may initiate a login directly (e.g. the user does not need to visit the endpoint first and then be redirected).

| `nameid_format` | string | Defines the name identifier format the SP expects the IdP to use in its assertions to identify subjects. If unspecified, a default value of `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent` will be used. A subset of the allowed values enumerated by the SAML specification are supported. |

| `allow_idp_initiated` | boolean | If true, the IdP may initiate a login directly (e.g. the user does not need to visit the endpoint first and then be redirected).

| `nameid_format` | string | Defines the name identifier format the SP expects the IdP to use in its assertions to identify subjects.

| `allow_idp_initiated` | boolean | If true, the IdP may initiate a login directly (e.g. the user does not need to visit the endpoint first and then be redirected).

| `metadata_url` | string | A public URL where the SP's metadata is hosted. If an IdP supports dynamic configuration, this is the URL it can use to retrieve the SP metadata. |
| `nameid_format` | string | Defines the name identifier format the SP expects the IdP to use in its assertions to identify subjects. If unspecified, a default value of `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent` will be used. A subset of the allowed values enumerated by the SAML specification are supported. |

POST /ssh_credentials

###### Parameters
|&nbsp;| &nbsp;| &nbsp;|
|---|---|---|
| `description` | string | human-readable description of who or what will use the ssh credential to authenticate. Optional, max 255 bytes. |
| `metadata` | string | arbitrary user-defined machine-readable data of this ssh credential. Optional, max 4096 bytes. |
| `acl` | List&lt;string&gt; | optional list of ACL rules. If unspecified, the credential will have no restrictions. The only allowed ACL rule at this time is the `bind` rule. The `bind` rule allows the caller to restrict what domains, addresses, and labels the token is allowed to bind. For example, to allow the token to open a tunnel on example.ngrok.io your ACL would include the rule `bind:example.ngrok.io`.

For example, you may specify a rule of `bind:*=example` which will allow `x=example`, `y=example`, etc. A rule of `'*'` is equivalent to no acl at all and will explicitly permit all actions. |

### Delete TLS Edge
Delete a TLS Edge by ID
##### Request
DELETE /edges/tls/{id}

##### Response
Returns a 204 response with no body on success

### Create Tunnel Credential
Create a new tunnel authtoken credential. This authtoken credential can be used to start a new tunnel session. The response to this API call is the only time the generated token is available. If you need it for future use, you must save it securely yourself.
##### Request
POST /credentials
<CredentialsCreateRequest />

###### Parameters
|&nbsp;| &nbsp;| &nbsp;|
|---|---|---|
| `description` | string | human-readable description of who or what will use the credential to authenticate. Optional, max 255 bytes. |
| `metadata` | string | arbitrary user-defined machine-readable data of this credential. Optional, max 4096 bytes. |
| `acl` | List&lt;string&gt; | optional list of ACL rules. If unspecified, the credential will have no restrictions. The only allowed ACL rule at this time is the `bind` rule. The `bind` rule allows the caller to restrict what domains, addresses, and labels the token is allowed to bind. For example, to allow the token to open a tunnel on example.ngrok.io your ACL would include the rule `bind:example.ngrok.io`. Bind rules for domains may specify a leading wildcard to match multiple domains with a common suffix. For example, you may specify a rule of `bind:*.example.com` which will allow `x.example.com`, `y.example.com`, `*.example.com`, etc. Bind rules for labels may specify a wildcard key and/or value to match multiple labels. For example, you may specify a rule of `bind:*=example` which will allow `x=example`, `y=example`, etc. A rule of `'*'` is equivalent to no acl at all and will explicitly permit all actions. |

| `acl` | List&lt;string&gt; | optional list of ACL rules. If unspecified, the credential will have no restrictions. The only allowed ACL rule at this time is the `bind` rule. The `bind` rule allows the caller to restrict what domains, addresses, and labels the token is allowed to bind. For example, to allow the token to open a tunnel on example.ngrok.io your ACL would include the rule `bind:example.ngrok.io`.

### Update Tunnel Agent
Issues a command instructing the ngrok agent to update itself to the latest version. After this call completes successfully, the ngrok agent will be in the update process. A caller should wait some amount of time to allow the update to complete (at least 10 seconds) before making a call to the Restart endpoint to request that the agent restart itself to start using the new code. This call will never update an ngrok agent to a new major version which could cause breaking compatibility issues. If you wish to update to a new major version, that must be done manually. Still, please be aware that updating your ngrok agent could break your integration. This call will fail in any of the following circumstances: there is no update available the ngrok agent's configuration disabled update checks the agent is currently in process of updating the agent has already successfully updated but has not yet been restarted
