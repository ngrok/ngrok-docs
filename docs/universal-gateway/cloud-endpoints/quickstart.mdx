[Cloud Endpoints](/universal-gateway/cloud-endpoints) are centrally managed endpoints in the cloud that can be used to route traffic to agent endpoints.

This guide will walk you through setting up a Cloud Endpoint quickly.

## Prerequisites

Whether you're using the API or the Dashboard, to create Cloud Endpoints you'll need:

- A reserved [domain](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains/) or [TCP address](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/tcp-addresses)
- If you're using the API, you'll need an [ngrok API key](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/api-keys)

## Dashboard

You can create Cloud Endpoints using [the ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/).

1. In the menu on the left side, [navigate to Universal Gateway > Endpoints](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/endpoints).
1. Select the **+ New** button, then select **Cloud Endpoint** in the modal that appears.
1. Select a **[binding](/universal-gateway/bindings)**. For this example, you can choose **public**.
1. Enter the URL you want to use for your endpoint. For example, for a public Cloud Endpoint that serves traffic over HTTPS you might use `https://my-app.ngrok.dev`.
1. Select **Create Cloud Endpoint**.

After completing these steps, you'll be taken to a page where you can manage your Cloud Endpoint's [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/). Visit the URL you specified to ensure that it's online. You should see a default landing page that says "This is your new Cloud Endpoint!"

## API

You can also create Cloud Endpoints programmatically via [the ngrok API](/api/). This example uses the ngrok CLI to interact with the API, but you can use any HTTP client of your choice.

Before you start, you'll need [your ngrok API Key](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/api-keys).

### **1** - Create your Traffic Policy

First, create a `policy.yml` on your local machine. The policy you'll create for this example will:

- Forward incoming HTTP requests to an Internal Endpoint (https://default.internal)
- If your Internal Endpoint is not reachable, it will fall back to a custom response

Paste the following into your `policy.yml` file:

```yaml title="policy.yml"
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: "forward-internal"
        config:
          url: "https://default.internal"
         on_error: continue
      - type: custom-response
        config:
          status_code: 200
          headers:
            content-type: text/html
          content: |
             <b>Agent offline!</b>
             <p>Run <code>ngrok http 80 --url https://default.internal</code> to put your application online!</p>

```

### **2** - Create your Cloud Endpoint

Now you can create your Cloud Endpoint by running the following command, replacing `{YOUR_API_KEY}` and `https://my-example-app.ngrok.dev` with your API key and desired URL:

```bash
ngrok api endpoints create \
 --api-key {YOUR_API_KEY} \
 --description "Cloud endpoint for my API" \
 --type cloud \
 --bindings public \
 --url https://my-example-app.ngrok.dev \
 --traffic-policy-file policy.yml
```

### **3** - Visit your endpoint

Your endpoint should be successfully online. Verify this by visiting the URL you assigned to it. You should see the content available at the [Internal Endpoint](/universal-gateway/internal-endpoints) you're forwarding traffic to.

If your Internal Endpoint is down, you should see the custom response you configured in your policy, which in thise case reads `Agent offline!`.

- See [the Cloud Endpoints overview](/universal-gateway/cloud-endpoints/) to learn about use cases, how they compare to Agent Endpoints, and more.
