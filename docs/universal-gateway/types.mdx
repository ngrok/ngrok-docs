Endpoints have a **type**, which can be either `agent` or `cloud`.

## Cloud Endpoints vs Agent Endpoints

In general, Cloud Endpoints are the most flexible option, but which endpoint type you should choose depends on your use-case. The following table outlines the differences between Cloud and Agent endpoints.

|                                                           | **[Cloud Endpoints](/universal-gateway/cloud-endpoints/)**                                             | **[Agent Endpoints](/universal-gateway/agent-endpoints/)**     |

### Protocols, Binding and Pooling

Both Agent and Cloud Endpoints support:

- All [Endpoint Protocols](/universal-gateway/protocols/)
  - `http/https`
  - `tcp`
  - `tls`
- All [Endpoint Bindings](/universal-gateway/bindings/)

  - `public`
  - `internal`
  - `kubernetes`

- [Endpoint Pooling](/universal-gateway/endpoint-pooling/). You can also pool Agent Endpoints with Cloud Endpoints.
