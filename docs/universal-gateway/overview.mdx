# Universal Gateway

ngrok's Universal Gateway is a globally distributed API Gateway. It secures,
accelerates and protects and accelerates your applications. We call it a
Universal Gateway because it also supports
[TCP](/universal-gateway/tcp/) and
[TLS](/universal-gateway/tls/) applications.

## Concepts

Dive into the different parts of the Universal Gateway, like Endpoints,
Bindings, Pools, and Domains, to understand how they work.

- [TCP Addresses →](/universal-gateway/tcp-addresses/)
- [TLS Certificates →](/universal-gateway/tls-certificates/)
- [Edges →](/universal-gateway/edges/)

## Endpoints

[Endpoints](/universal-gateway/endpoints/) are how ngrok enables traffic to reach your services.

Learn more about Endpoints:

- [Bindings →](/universal-gateway/bindings/)
- [Internal Endpoints →](/universal-gateway/internal-endpoints/)
- [Public Endpoints →](/universal-gateway/public-endpoints/)
- [Kubernetes Endpoints →](/universal-gateway/kubernetes-endpoints/)

## Load Balancing

Endpoints Pools make load balancing dead simple. When your create two endpoints
with the same URL (and binding), those endpoints automatically "pool" together
and traffic to their URL is balanced among them.

## TLS

ngrok automatically handles TLS (SSL) termination and certificate management
for you. There is typically nothing to setup, configure or manage.

## Global Load Balancer

ngrok's Global Load Balancer automatically improves the performance and
resiliency of your applications by distributing traffic to the nearest healthy
point of presence, measured by latency, from the perspective of the connecting
client.

## DDoS Protection

ngrok automatically protects your applications with out-of-the-box protection
from distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.
