title: Public Endpoints
description: Learn about enabling internet traffic to your services with public endpoints.
---

Public endpoints enable your services to receive geo-balanced internet traffic using [ngrok's global points of presence](/docs/universal-gateway/edges/).

Public endpoints enable you to receive traffic from the internet via ngrok’s [global points of presence](/docs/universal-gateway/edges/). This is the most common type of endpoint and the easiest way to start.

Public endpoint URLs must:

- Use either a [Domain](/universal-gateway/domains/) or [TCP Address](/universal-gateway/tcp-addresses/)
- Use the `public` [binding](/docs/universal-gateway/bindings/)

## Get started

You can create a public endpoint using:

- [The dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/endpoints)
- [The API](/docs/api/resources/endpoints/#create-endpoint).

Follow the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/) guide to set up an ngrok account and create your first public endpoint.

## Authentication

Public endpoints are useful out of the box for content you don’t want to restrict access to, such as blogs or marketing sites; but they can also be used for services that require strict access control such as dashboards or private APIs.

To keep such services both public and secure, you can add a Traffic Policy to your endpoint for authentication and authorization. Traffic Policy actions enable you to do the following with your endpoints:

- [JWT Validation](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/jwt-validation/)
- [OAuth](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/oauth/)
- [OIDC](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/oidc/)
- [IP restrictions](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/restrict-ips/)
- [Mutual TLS](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/terminate-tls/#example-traffic-policy-document)

## URLs

When you create a public endpoint, the URL you create it with is validated
differently based on the protocol of the URL.

### `http`

- The hostname must match a [Domain](/universal-gateway/domains/) in your account.
- The hostname must be a domain with a valid [public suffix](https://publicsuffix.org/).
- The port must be `80`. If you do not specify a port, the default `80` will be used for you.

**Examples**

- `http://example.ngrok.app`
- `http://example.ngrok.app:80`
- `http://example.party`
- `http://example.ngrok.app:81` - invalid port, must be `80`, not `81`
- `http://example.doesnotexist` - invalid hostname: `.doesnotexist` is not a public suffix domain
- `http://example.internal` - invalid hostname: `.internal` is not a public suffix domain

### `https`, `tls`

- The hostname must match a [Domain](/universal-gateway/domains/) in your account.
- The hostname must be a domain with a valid [public suffix](https://publicsuffix.org/).
- The port must be `443`. If you do not specify a port, the default `443` will be used for you.

**Examples**

- `https://example.ngrok.app`
- `https://example.ngrok.app:443`
- `https://example.party`
- `https://example.ngrok.app:8443` - invalid port, must be `443`
- `https://example.nosuchtld` - invalid hostname, `.nosuchtld` is not a public suffix domain
- `https://example.internal` - invalid hostname, public endpoints cannot use `.internal`

### `tcp`

- You must specify a port number in TCP URLs.
- The hostname and port must match the address of a [TCP
  Address](/universal-gateway/tcp-addresses) in your account.

**Examples**

- `tcp://1.tcp.ngrok.io:12345`
- `tcp://1.tcp.eu.ngrok.io:12345`
- `tcp://1.tcp.ngrok.io` - invalid, does not specify a port number
- `tcp://example.ngrok.app:12345` - invalid, does not match a TCP Address
- `tcp://your-domain.com:12345` - invalid, does not match a TCP Address

## API

Public endpoints can be created programatically. Consult the documentation on
[Endpoint APIs](/api/resources/endpoints/).

## Pricing

Public endpoints are available on all plans. Consult the [Endpoints
Pricing](/universal-gateway/endpoints/#pricing) documentation for
billing details.
