description: Learn how ngrok enables you to load balance traffic between endpoints with endpoint pooling.
---

Endpoint pooling makes load balancing dead simple. Load balancing helps you
scale traffic across multiple replicas of your app to increase capacity,
tolerate failures and geo-distribute load. When your create two endpoints with the same URL (and binding), those endpoints automatically form a "pool" and share incoming traffic.

## vs. Other load balancing systems

Endpoint pooling is vastly more flexible than comparable load balancing
systems:

- Endpoints join and leave pools automatically as they are created and
  destroyed, there is no need to register your upstreams ahead of time.
- You can define your own _dyanmic_ load balancing strategies. For example, you
  can define strategies that adjust traffic distribution based on the
  performance of upstream services or properties of the incoming requests.
- You can pool endpoints with different Traffic Policies. This means that not
  only can you blue-green and canary deploy your own apps, you can also do that
  with the Traffic Policies themselves. This helps you dramatically mitigate the
  risk of gateway changes that so often cause site-wide outages.

## When to use Endpoint Pooling

Endpoint pooling is a good choice when you want to:

- Load balance among multiple replicas of the same application, even running in
  different cloud providers, on-prem, etc.
- Switch from agent endpoints to cloud endpoints with no downtime (or
  vice-versa)
- Implement blue-green deployments to reduce risk and rollback times
- Deploy canary version of your application
- A/B test different version of your apps with blue-green deployments
- Gradually roll out changes to an endpoint's Traffic Policy

## Quickstart

### Agent Endpoints

Create two endpoints with the same URL forwarding to two different ports. They
will automatically be pooled together.

```
ngrok http 8080 --url https://your-domain.ngrok.app --pooling-enabled true
```

```
ngrok http 9090 --url https://your-domain.ngrok.app --pooling-enabled true
```

When you make requests to the endpoints' URL, you will see responses balanced
among each endpoint in the pool.

```
curl https://your-domain.ngrok.app
<Response from 8080>

curl https://your-domain.ngrok.app
<Response from 9090>
```

### Cloud Endpoints

Create two endpoints with the same URL and two different traffic policies. They
will automatically be pooled together.

First, create two traffic policy files, `policy-a.yml` and `policy-b.yml`.

```yaml title="policy-a.yml" mode=traffic-policy
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: custom-response
        config:
          status_code: 200
          content: Policy A
```

```yaml title="policy-b.yml" mode=traffic-policy
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: custom-response
        config:
          status_code: 200
          content: Policy B
```

Then create two cloud endpoints, one with each policy:

```sh title="Command line"
ngrok api endpoints create \
    --url https://your-domain.ngrok.app \
    --traffic-policy "$(cat policy-a.yml)" \
    --pooling-enabled=true

ngrok api endpoints create \
    --url https://your-domain.ngrok.app \
    --traffic-policy "$(cat policy-b.yml)" \
    --pooling-enabled=true
```

When you make requests to the endpoints' URL, you will see responses balanced
among each endpoint in the pool.

```sh title="Command line"
curl https://your-domain.ngrok.app
<Response from 8080>

curl https://your-domain.ngrok.app
<Response from 9090>
```

## Lifecycle

An Endpoint Pool is automatically created whenever you create two endpoints with:

- The same URL
- The same binding
- Pooling enabled

When only a single endpoint remains in a pool, the pool is deleted.

## Enabling Pooling

Endpoint pooling is disabled by default. Endpoint pooling is enabled on a per-endpoint basis. You must enable pooling on each endpoint you want to pool by setting
`pooling_enabled` to `true`.

## Pool Size

There is no limit on the number of endpoints that may be in a pool.

## Conflicts

If you create a second endpoint with the same URL and binding as an existing
endpoint, both the new endpoint and existing endpoint must have [pooling
enabled](#enabling-pooling). If they do not, ngrok will return a conflict error
when attempting to start the second endpoint.

The URLs of all endpoints in a pool must share the same protocol. For example,
you may not pool the endpoints `https://foo.internal:1234` and
`tcp://foo.internal:1234` together because they have a different protocol.

Conflicts can only occur during endpoint creation because both the URL and the
pooling enabled property may not be updated after an endpoint has been created.

## Load Balancing

Traffic to pooled URLs is load balanced among the endpoints in the pool. Load
balancing is applied in two places:

- When pooled public and kubernetes endpoints load balance traffic received
  from external clients.
- When pooled internal endpoints receive traffic that is forwarded to them via
  the `forward-internal` Traffic Policy action.

### Granularity

ngrok intelligently chooses the load balancing layer automatically for you.

Traffic to TCP and TLS endpoints is balanced on a per-connection basis (layer
4).

Traffic to HTTP and HTTPS endpoints balanced on a per-request basis (layer 7).
If multiple endpoints in a pool have different `on_tcp_connect` phases in their
Traffic Policy, load balancing is instead done on a per-connection basis (layer
4).

### Heterogenous Endpoints

Endpoints in a pool may have different Traffic Policies. This lets you run old
and new Traffic Policies side-by-side during a transition. It also enables you
to roll out new Traffic Policy changes without risking an all-or-nothing
deployment.

When traffic is balanced among endpoints with different Traffic Policies, ngrok
first chooses an endpoint to balance to and then executes the Traffic Policy of
the chosen endpoint.

### Default Strategy

ngrok's default balancing strategy attempts to strike a balance between
performance and faireness:

- First, it identifies all endpoints in the pool which are in the point of
  presence closest to where a connection is received.
- Then, connections are balanced in a random distribution among those
  endpoints.

For the purposes of the first step, [cloud
endpoints](/universal-gateway/cloud-endpoints) are considered to be online in
all points of presence.

For example, if an endpoint pool consist of the following endpoints:

- Endpoint A: Agent Endpoint connected to `eu`
- Endpoint B: Agent Endpoint connected `eu`
- Endpoint C: Agent Endpoint connected `us`
- Endpoint D: Cloud Endpoint

Then:

- A connection received in `eu` will be balanced among endpoints A, B, D
- A connection received in `us` will be balanced among endpoints C, D
- A connection received in `jp` will be balanced among endpoints D

## Custom Strategies

When balancing traffic to internal endpoints you may define your own balancing
strategy by setting the `endpoint_selectors` and `endpoint_weights` fields on
the `forward-internal` Traffic Policy action configuration.

Custom load balancing strategies are not yet generally available, [request access to the
developer preview](mailto:support@ngrok.com).

### Retries

When a connection or request is balanced to an endpoint in a pool, if that
connection or request fails, it is not retried by sending it to another
endpoint in the pool.

## Wildcard endpoints

[Wildcard endpoints](/universal-gateway/wildcard-domains/wildcard-endpoints) do not pool with non-wildcard URLs. See [the docs on Wildcard Endpoints](/universal-gateway/wildcard-domains/wildcard-endpoints/#wildcard-endpoint-pooling) for more information.

## Protocol, Binding and Type

- Endpoint pooling supports all endpoint protocols
- Endpoint pooling supports all endpoint bindings
- Endpoint pooling supports all endpoint types (and you can mix types in an endpoint pool)

## API

Because endpoint pools are created on-demand when two endpoints share the same
URL and binding, there is no API resource for endpoint pools. Instead, each
[Endpoint API Resource](/api/resources/endpoints/) has a read-only `pools`
field which lists the other endpoints in the same pool as the requested
endpoint.

## Pricing

Endpoint pooling is available on the Pay-As-You-Go plan. Each endpoint in a pool is billed
separately.
