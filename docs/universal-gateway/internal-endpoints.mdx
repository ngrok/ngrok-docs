**Internal Endpoints** are private endpoints that only receive traffic when forwarded through the [`forward-internal` traffic policy action](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/forward-internal/). This allows you to route traffic to an application through ngrok without making it publicly addressable.

Internal endpoint URLs must:

- End with the `.internal` domain extension
- Use the `internal` [binding](/docs/universal-gateway/bindings/)

A common practice is to use a [public](/docs/universal-gateway/public-endpoints) [cloud endpoints](/docs/universal-gateway/cloud-endpoints/) to manage a centralized Traffic Policy, then forward traffic to one or more internal [endpoints](/docs/universal-gateway/endpoints/). See [the guide on using cloud endpoints with internal endpoints](/docs/guides/other-guides/forwarding-and-load-balancing-with-cloud-endpoints/) to learn more.

## Quickstart

### Agent Endpoint

Create an internal agent endpoint by specifying a binding of `internal` when
you create an endpoint.

```bash
ngrok http 8080 --url "https://example.internal" --binding internal
```

### Cloud Endpoint

Instead of an agent endpoint, you can create an internal cloud endpoint.

Specify a binding of `internal` when you create the cloud endpoint.

```bash
ngrok api create \
  --type cloud \
  --binding internal \
  --url "https://example.internal" \
  --traffic-policy "$(cat traffic-policy.yml)"
```

##### `traffic-policy.yml`

```yaml
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: custom-response
        config:
          status_code: 200
          headers:
            content-type: text/plain
          content: "Hello world!"
```

### Forwarding

Internal endpoints arenâ€™t directly accessible. To send traffic to an Internal Endpoint, you must create an endpoint that uses the Traffic Policy to forward traffic using the [`forward-internal` action](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/forward-internal/).

For example, to route public traffic to your internal endpoint, use the following command and traffic policy to create a Public Cloud Endpoint that forwards requests to your Internal Endpoint:

```bash
ngrok api create \
  --type cloud \
  --url "https://your-name.ngrok.app" \
  --traffic-policy "$(cat traffic-policy.yml)"
```

##### `traffic-policy.yml`

```yaml
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: https://example.internal
```

Now, when you make a request to `https://your-name.ngrok.app`, ngrok applies the specified traffic policy. This policy instructs ngrok to use the forward-internal action, routing the incoming HTTP request directly to your internal endpoint at `https://example.internal`.

This configuration lets you manage how traffic reaches your service without requiring it to be directly accessible on the public internet.

## Inferred Binding

ngrok automatically infers an `internal` binding for any endpoint created with a `.internal` hostname, so you can omit the `binding` property in most cases.

For example, the following command creates an endpoint with an internal binding:

```bash
ngrok http 8080 --url "https://example.internal"
```

## URLs

- **Scheme** - Internal endpoints support all [Endpoint Protocols](/universal-gateway/endpoints/#protocol) (`http`, `https`, `tcp` and `tls`).
- **Hostname** - Hostnames **must** end with `.internal` and may contain up to 5 subdomains. You must specify a URL with a hostname, randomly-assigned hostnames are not supported. You may specify wildcard hostnames.
- **Port** - All port numbers [1-65535] are valid. For `tcp` endpoints, you **must** specify a port.
- **Namespacing** - Internal endpoints are namespaced on a per-account basis.
  This means that, two different accounts may have internal endpoints with the same URL (e.g. `https://api.internal`) without conflict or interference in [endpoint pooling](/universal-gateway/endpoint-pooling).

#### Examples

- `https://example.internal`
- `https://example.foo.bar.internal`
- `https://example.internal:12345`
- `tls://example.internal`
- `tls://example.internal:12345`
- `tcp://example.internal:12345`

## Type and Pooling

- Internal endpoints support both [Endpoint Types](/universal-gateway/endpoints/#type): `agent` and `cloud`.
- Internal endpoints support [Endpoint Pooling](/universal-gateway/endpoint-pooling).

## HTTP/S `on_tcp_connect` phase

For internal `http` and `https` endpoints, the `on_tcp_connect` [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/) phase is not applicable and never triggers.

This is because when you use the [`forward-internal` action](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/forward-internal/) to forward traffic to an `http` or `https` endpoint, no new TCP connection is established. For additional details, see the [`forward-internal` documentation](/traffic-policy/actions/forward-internal/).

## API

Internal endpoints can be managed programatically. To get started, consult the
[Endpoints API documentation](/universal-gateway/endpoints/#api).

## Pricing

Internal endpoints are available on the Pay-as-you-go plan. Consult the [Endpoints Pricing](/universal-gateway/endpoints/#pricing) documentation for billing details.
