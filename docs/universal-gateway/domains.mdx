# Domains

## Overview

Domains enable you to create public endpoints with hostnames matching the
domain. For example, after you create the domain `your-name.ngrok.app`, you may
create the Endpoint `https://your-name.ngrok.app`

Domain names may be a subdomain of an [ngrok-managed
domain](#ngrok-managed-domains) like `foo.ngrok.app` or you can [bring your own
domain](#branded-domains) like `example.your-domain.com` by creating a CNAME
DNS record with your domain's DNS provider.

Domains also enable you configure other domain-level behaviors including:

- [**Global Load Balancer configuration**](#global-load-balancer) - Choose which points of presence handle traffic to a Domain's matching endpoints.
- [**TLS Certificate management**](#tls-certificates) - Configure automatic certificate provisioning or select a certificate you uploaded yourself.
- [**Dedicated IP address configuration**](#dedicated-ips) - Attach static, dedicated IPs for a Domain's matching endpoints receive traffic on.

You can manage Domains on your [ngrok Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains)
or via the [ngrok API](#api).

## Public endpoints

A Domain's primary responsibility is to enable you to create [public
endpoints](/universal-gateway/public-endpoints/) with a hostname matching the
domain. These are called "matching endpoints". For example, after you create
the Domain `app.example.com`, you can create the Endpoint
`https://app.example.com`.

When you create a Domain, you may create matching public endpoints with the
following constraints:

| Endpoint Protocol | Allowed Endpoints                                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `http`            | Matching endpoints on port `80` of the Domain.                                                   |
| `https`           | Matching endpoints on port `443` of the Domain.                                                  |
| `tls`             | Matching endpoints on port `443` of the Domain.                                                  |
| `tcp`             | Not allowed. Public TCP endpoints must match a [TCP Address](/universal-gateway/tcp-addresses/). |

If you configure your Domain to use [dedicated IPs](#dedicated-ips), these
restrictions are removed and you may create matching endpoints on any ports.

### Wildcard Domains

You may create a Domain with a wildcard name, e.g. `*.example.com`. A wildcard
domain enables you to:

- Create an endpoint which receives traffic for all of its subdomains, e.g.
  `https://*.example.com`. Consult the documentation for [wildcard
  endpoints](/universal-gateway/http/#wildcard-endpoints) to understand
  the rules for matching and precedence.

- Create an endpoint on any subdomain which matches the wildcard, e.g.
  `https://foo.example.com` or `https://foo.bar.baz.example.com`

The wildcard `*` character may only be used as the first part of a
domain, you may not create domains like `app.*.example.com` or
`*-app.example.com`.

:::note
Wildcard domains are available on our Enterprise plan self service. They are also available on Pay-as-You-Go plans if you contact support@ngrok.com. For Pay-as-You-Go when you create a wildcard domain and run endpoints domain `*.foo.com`, endpoints `https://a.foo.com` and `https://b.foo.com`, we bill you for each individual endpoint, which is why we ask that you request the feature.
:::

:::note
Reserving subdomains of a wildcard domain within the ngrok dashboard count towards the number of reserved domains in your account. For example, if you reserve `foo.example.com` and `*.example.com`, you have reserved two domains.
:::

### Ownership

Your account exclusively owns its Domains and all of their nested subdomains
within ngrok. That means:

- No account may create a Domain with a name that is a subdomain of your Domains.
- No other account may create endpoints with a hostname matching your Domain or
  any of its nested subdomains.

For example, if you create a Domain with the name `foo.ngrok.app`:

- No other account create the Domains `foo.ngrok.app` or `bar.foo.ngrok.app`.
- No other account may create the endpoints `https://foo.ngrok.app` or `https://bar.foo.ngrok.app`.

## Bring your own domain {#branded-domains}

You can use any custom domain name that you already own with ngrok, e.g.
`app.your-domain.com`. To do so, see [the docs on using custom domains](/universal-gateway/custom-domains).
## Global Load Balancer

The [Global Load Balancer](/universal-gateway/global-load-balancer)
uses latency-aware DNS records to direct clients to the IPs of the nearest
[points of presence](/universal-gateway/points-of-presence/).

Domains allow you to configure which points of presence the Global Load
Balancer may resolve clients to. This allows you to select which points of
presence will receive traffic for the Domain's matching endpoints. To disable
the Global Load Balancer, you may configure a domain to only resolve a single
point of presence.

:::info Coming Soon

Per-region global load balancer configuration is coming soon, [request access
to the developer preview](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/developer-preview).

:::

## TLS Certificates

Domains manage the [TLS Certificate](/universal-gateway/tls-certificates/) used
to terminate TLS connections to the Domain's matching endpoints. When you
create a Domain, you may choose to allow ngrok to automatically provision TLS
certificates for you or to upload your own TLS certificate.

Consult the documentation on [TLS
Certificates](/universal-gateway/tls-certificates/) for additional details on
certificate provisioning and management.

## Dedicated IPs

By default, a Domain's matching Endpoints receive traffic on a set of
multi-tenant [IP addresses](/universal-gateway/ip-addresses) that are
shared among all ngrok accounts. You may instead configure a Domain's matching
endpoints to receive traffic on IP addresses that are dedicated to your
account.

If your Domain uses dedicated IPs, you may create public endpoints on _any_
port numbers, not just 80 and 443.

:::info Coming Soon

Dedicated, static IPs for your domains are coming soon, [request access to the
developer preview](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/developer-preview).

## ngrok Managed Domains

If you don't own a domain that you want to use with ngrok, you can create a
Domain that is a subdomain of an ngrok-managed base domain. The ngrok-managed
base domains are:

| Domain             | Availability                                      | HSTS Global Preload |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `ngrok.app`        | Available to paying accounts                      | Yes                 |
| `ngrok.dev`        | Available to paying accounts                      | Yes                 |
| `ngrok.pizza`      | Available to paying accounts                      | No                  |
| `ngrok-free.app`   | Used by free accounts                             | Yes                 |
| `ngrok-free.dev`   | Used by free accounts                             | Yes                 |
| `ngrok-free.pizza` | Used by free accounts (coming soon)               | No                  |
| `ngrok.io`         | Discontinued and only available to older accounts | No                  |

### Public Suffix List

The ngrok-managed base domains are on the [Public Suffix
List](https://publicsuffix.org/). Browsers use the Public Suffix List to
guarantee that cookies from one subdomain cannot be accessed by other
subdomains.

### HSTS Preload

Some of the ngrok-managed base domains are on the global
[HSTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security) preload
list. If the domain of the URL is on the [global HSTS preload
list](https://hstspreload.org/), modern browsers automatically convert requests
with an `http` scheme to `https`.

If you need to create unencrypted `http` endpoints, you should create them with
hostnames that are not on the HSTS Global Preload like `ngrok.io` and
`ngrok.pizza`.

ngrok does not prohibit you from creating `http` endpoints with hostnames whose
base domain is on the global HSTS preload list because non-browser clients
(like `curl`) can still be used to make unencrypted HTTP requests to them.

## API

Domains are programatically managed via:

- [`/reserved_domains` API Resource](/api/resources/reserved-domains/)

## Pricing

Domains are available on all plans. Some Domain features require upgrades. See
the [Pricing page](https://ngrok.com/pricing) for details.
