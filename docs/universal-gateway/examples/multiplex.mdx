Multiplexing is a common gateway design where you host multiple services from a single fully qualified domain name (FQDN) like `example.com`.
For example, `app.example.com` can serve a static web app while `api.example.com` serves a JSON API using entirely different services and infrastructure.

ngrok simplifies multiplexing by letting you:

1. Put a URL online to accept internet traffic to a [Cloud Endpoint](/docs/universal-gateway/cloud-endpoints/), which allows you to control how that traffic accesses the internal resources where your [internal Agent Endpoints](/docs/universal-gateway/agent-endpoints/) are running. We call this the ["front door"](/docs/universal-gateway/examples/front-door-pattern) pattern.
2. Use [Traffic Policy](/docs/traffic-policy) to create dynamic routing topologies based on subdomains or headers.
3. Add new services behind your gateway without service discovery, manual registration, certificate management, split-horizon DNS zones, or any other complex networking configurations.

## 1. Create endpoints for your services

Start internal [Agent Endpoints](/docs/universal-gateway/agent-endpoints/), replacing `$PORT` based on where your service listens, for each of your services on the systems where they run.
You can also use one of our [SDKs](/docs/agent-sdks/#example-usage) or the [Kubernetes Operator](/docs/getting-started/kubernetes/ingress/).

```bash
ngrok http $PORT --url https://foo.internal
ngrok http $PORT --url https://bar.internal
ngrok http $PORT --url https://baz.internal
```

Make sure the hostname of the internal endpoint matches the subdomain or header value you want to use for routing.

- `https://foo.example.com` &rarr; `https://foo.internal`
- `x-service: bar` &rarr; `https://bar.internal`

## 2. Reserve a domain

<ReserveDomain />

## 3. Create a Cloud Endpoint

<CloudEndpoint />

## 4. Add multiplexing with Traffic Policy

While still viewing your new Cloud Endpoint in the dashboard, copy and paste one of the two policies below into the Traffic Policy editor depending on whether you want to route by hostname/subdomain or header value.

<Tabs>
	<TabItem value="subdomain" label="By subdomain" default>
		```yaml
		on_http_request:
			- actions:
					- type: forward-internal
						config:
							url: https://${req.host.split(".$NGROK_DOMAIN")[0]}.internal 
		```

    	**What's happening here?**
    	This policy forwards every HTTP request to one of your internal Agent Endpoints, which in turn forward traffic to your internal services.
    	The [`split` macro](/docs/traffic-policy/macros/#stringsplit---list) dynamically routes traffic based on the incoming hostname so that the policy forwards requests to the `foo` subdomain to `https://foo.internal`, and so on.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="header" label="By header">
    	```yaml
    	on_http_request:
    	  - actions:
    				- type: forward-internal
    					config:
    						url: https://${getReqHeader('x-service')[0]}.internal
    	```

    	**What's happening here?**
    	This policy forwards every HTTP request to one of your internal Agent Endpoints, which in turn forward traffic to your internal services.
    	The [`split` macro](/docs/traffic-policy/macros/#stringsplit---list) dynamically routes traffic based on the `x-service` header so that the policy forwards requests with the `x-service: foo` header to `https://foo.internal`, and so on.
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## 5. Try out your endpoint

Visit the domain you reserved either in the browser or in the terminal using a tool like `curl`.
When you try various subdomains or header values in your requests, you should see your various APIs or apps as they're connected to your internal Agent Endpoints.

## What's next?

- Add authentication like [JWT
  validation](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/jwt-validation) or [IP restrictions](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/restrict-ips) to some or all of your multiplexed services, or even [combine multiple methods](/docs/universal-gateway/examples/combine-auth-methods/) to let users authenticate with one `OR` another method.
- View your traffic in [Traffic
  Inspector](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/traffic-inspector) to ensure multiplexing works as expected or to find potentially abusive patterns you can block using [IP Intelligence](/docs/traffic-policy/variables/ip-intel/) or the [OWASP action](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/owasp-crs-request/).
