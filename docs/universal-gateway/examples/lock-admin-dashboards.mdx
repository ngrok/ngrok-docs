Even if your admin dashboards and internal tools already have built-in authentication, you can make them even secure using ngrok and Traffic Policy to restrict specific types of traffic from even hitting your endpoint.

You can restrict access to specific IP addresses, block traffic from problematic sources, restrict requests to only your geographical area, or all the above.
In this example, we're assuming that your admin tool is part of your public-facing service, available on a path like `/admin`.

## 1. Start an endpoint for your service

Start an internal [Agent Endpoint](/docs/universal-gateway/agent-endpoints/), replacing `$PORT` based on where your service listens.
You can also use one of our [SDKs](/docs/agent-sdks) or the [Kubernetes Operator](/docs/k8s).

```bash
ngrok http $PORT --url https://service.internal
```

## 2. Reserve a domain

<ReserveDomain />

## 3. Create a Cloud Endpoint

<CloudEndpoint />

## 4. Restrict access to your admin path with Traffic Policy

While still viewing your new cloud endpoint in the dashboard, copy and paste the policy below into the Traffic Policy editor.
You may need to change:

- `/admin`: Replace with the path of your admin tools.
- `1.2.3.4/5.6.7.8`: Replace with public IPs of your admins.
- `US`: Replace with the country code where your admins would log in to.

```yaml
on_http_request:
  - expressions:
      - "req.url.path.includes('/admin')"
      - "conn.client_ip.geo.location.country_code != 'US' || req.user_agent.is_bot || 'proxy.anonymous.tor, blocklist.co.greensnow' in conn.client_ip.categories"
    actions:
      - type: deny
  - expressions:
      - "req.url.path.includes('/admin')"
    actions:
      - type: restrict-ips
        config:
          allow:
            - 1.2.3.4/32
            - 5.6.7.8/32
  - actions:
      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: https://service.internal
```

**What's happening here?** Your policy checks every HTTP request and filters out only those to the `/admin` path, first denying all requests from non-US traffic, bot traffic, Tor networks, and all IPs on the GreenSnow blocklist.
For all requests not immediately denied, ngrok then also restricts access to only specific and trusted IP addresses before forwarding to your upstream service.

ngrok forwards all requests to paths other than `/admin` without these filters or actions.

## 5. Try out your restricted admin tools

<TryOut />
