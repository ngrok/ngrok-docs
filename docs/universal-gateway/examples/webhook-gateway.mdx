Instead of implementing webhook validation and routing logic separately in every service, a webhook gateway provides a single, secure entry point for all third-party webhooks from providers like Stripe, Twilio, Slack, and GitHub. This centralized approach validates webhook signatures, prevents tampering, and routes authenticated requests to the appropriate internal services.

With this setup, you can:

- Validate webhook signatures from 70+ supported providers in a single place
- Route authenticated webhooks to appropriate services based on the provider
- Prevent webhook spoofing and tampering with cryptographic verification
- Standardize webhook handling across your entire infrastructure
- Apply consistent logging and monitoring to all webhook traffic

## 1. Create endpoints for your services

Start internal [Agent Endpoints](/docs/universal-gateway/agent-endpoints/) for the services that will handle webhooks from different providers.
You can also use one of our [SDKs](/docs/agent-sdks) or the [Kubernetes Operator](/docs/k8s).

For a payment service handling Stripe webhooks:

```bash
ngrok http $PAYMENT_SERVICE_PORT --url https://payment-service.internal
```

For a notification service handling Slack webhooks:

```bash
ngrok http $NOTIFICATION_SERVICE_PORT --url https://notification-service.internal
```

For a deployment service handling GitHub webhooks:

```bash
ngrok http $DEPLOYMENT_SERVICE_PORT --url https://deployment-service.internal
```

## 2. Reserve a domain

<ReserveDomain />

## 3. Create a Cloud Endpoint

<CloudEndpoint />

## 4. (Optional) Create a vault and secrets

For production environments, store your webhook secrets securely using [Secrets for Traffic Policy](/docs/traffic-policy/secrets). This step is optional—you can also use plaintext secrets directly in your policy.

Create a vault to store your webhook secrets:

```bash
ngrok api vaults create --name "webhook-secrets" --description "Webhook validation secrets"
```

Add your credentials to the vault, replacing the names and values, plus changing `$VAULT_ID` to match the vault ID from the response:

```bash
# Add Stripe webhook secret
ngrok api secrets create \
  --name "stripe-secret" \
  --value "your_stripe_secret_here" \
  --vault-id "vault_2yNPzuk6GjHrx3mlOCkJK42RsdR"

# Add Slack webhook secret
ngrok api secrets create \
  --name "slack-secret" \
  --value "your_slack_verification_token_here" \
  --vault-id "vault_2yNPzuk6GjHrx3mlOCkJK42RsdR"

# Add GitHub webhook secret
ngrok api secrets create \
  --name "github-secret" \
  --value "your_github_webhook_secret_here" \
  --vault-id "vault_2yNPzuk6GjHrx3mlOCkJK42RsdR"
```

## 5. Apply Traffic Policy to your Cloud Endpoint

While still viewing your new cloud endpoint in the dashboard, copy and paste one of the policies below into the Traffic Policy editor.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="secrets" label="Using Secrets (Recommended)" default>

```yaml
on_http_request:
  - expressions:
      # Route Stripe webhooks to payment service
      - "req.url.path.startsWith('/stripe')"
    actions:
      - type: verify-webhook
        config:
          provider: stripe
          secret: "${secrets.get('webhook-secrets', 'stripe-secret')}"
      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: https://payment-service.internal
s
  - expressions:
      # Route Slack webhooks to notification service
      - "req.url.path.startsWith('/slack')"
    actions:
      - type: verify-webhook
        config:
          provider: slack
          secret: "${secrets.get('webhook-secrets', 'slack-secret')}"
      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: https://notification-service.internal

  - expressions:
      # Route GitHub webhooks to deployment service
      - "req.url.path.startsWith('/github')"
    actions:
      - type: verify-webhook
        config:
          provider: github
          secret: "${secrets.get('webhook-secrets', 'github-secret')}"
      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: https://deployment-service.internal
```

**What's happening here?** This policy routes incoming webhook requests based on their URL path. Each route first validates the webhook signature using secrets stored in your encrypted vault, then forwards authenticated requests to the appropriate internal service. If signature verification fails, the request is automatically rejected, protecting your services from spoofed or tampered webhooks.

## 6. Try out your endpoint

<TryOut />

Configure your webhook endpoints in each provider's dashboard:

- **Stripe**: `https://$NGROK_DOMAIN/stripe`
- **Slack**: `https://$NGROK_DOMAIN/slack`
- **GitHub**: `https://$NGROK_DOMAIN/github`

When webhooks are sent from these providers, they'll be validated and routed to your internal services automatically.

## What's next?

- View the complete list of [70+ supported webhook providers](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/verify-webhook/#supported-providers) including Twilio, Shopify, and DocuSign
- Add the [`log` action](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/log) to send webhook events to your observability platform for monitoring and debugging
- Use [Traffic Inspector](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/traffic-inspector) to monitor webhook delivery and troubleshoot validation failures
- Learn more about [webhook signature verification](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/verify-webhook) and security best practices
