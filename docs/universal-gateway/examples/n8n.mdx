n8n allows you to self-host, which is great when you're testing workflows, but when you're ready to turn your instance into a production-ready automation solution and don't want to buy a domain or pay for hosting, you might feel lost.

ngrok works with the [self-hosted and enterprise editions](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/) of n8n, including both Docker and npm-based installs, to securely expose them to the public internet.
That way, you can share n8n with colleagues or accept webhooks to fire off workflows.

## 1. Reserve a domain

<ReserveDomain domain="https://your-n8n-instance.ngrok.app" />

## 2. Start your n8n endpoint

On the same system where n8n runs, start the agent on port `5678`, which is the default for n8n, and reference the `n8n.yaml` file you just created.
Be sure to also change `$NGROK_DOMAIN` to the domain you reserved earlier.

```bash
ngrok http 5678 --url https://$NGROK_DOMAIN
```

## 3. Try out your n8n endpoint

<TryOut />

## Optional: Secure your n8n dashboard with Traffic Policy

Even though n8n comes with built-in user administration, you can protect the sign-in page from automated attacks by restricting access to only trusted IPs.

Go to our [IP address helper tool](https://ipv4.ngrok.com/) to get your public IP address.

Next, create a file named `n8n.yaml` on the same system where n8n runs and paste in the following policy, replacing `$YOUR_IP`.

```yaml
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: restrict-ips
        config:
          enforce: true
          allow:
            - "$YOUR_IP/32"
```

**What's happening here?**
This policy applies the [`restrict-ips`](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/restrict-ips) Traffic Policy action and allows only
devices with a matching IP address to access your n8n instance.
All other requests are denied at ngrok's network without reaching your service.

Restart your ngrok agent to apply the new policy.

```bash
ngrok http 5678 --url https://$NGROK_DOMAIN --traffic-policy-file n8n.yaml
```

## Optional: Enforce verification on incoming webhooks

If you want to receive webhooks from external services, but also want to control precisely which services can send these requests and during what conditions, you can use the [`verify-webhooks` action](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/verify-webhooks).

For example, if you want to verify a webhook from GitHub, create or edit a your `n8n.yaml` file and paste in the policy below.
Replace `$WORKFLOW_UUID` with your workflow's path and `$SECRET` with the secret you configured when you created your webhook.

```yaml
on_http_request:
  - expressions:
      - "req.url.path.contains('/webhook/$WORKFLOW_UUID')"
    actions:
      - type: verify-webhook
        config:
          provider: github
          secret: $SECRET
```

**What's happening here?** This policy filters for _only_ traffic that contains the specific `/webhook/$WORKFLOW_UUID` path, then verfies that it both originates from GitHub (or another [supported provider](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/verify-webhook/#supported-providers)) and contains the appropriate secret.

Restart your ngrok agent to apply the new policy.

```bash
ngrok http 5678 --url https://$NGROK_DOMAIN --traffic-policy-file n8n.yaml
```

### Configure both IP restrictions and webhook verification

If you configured IP restrictions earlier, and _then_ set up webhook verification, you'll find that your webhooks won't work because you haven't added the provider's IP to your `restrict-ips` action to allow them.
Because it's next to impossible to identify all the IPs where a provider's webhooks might come from, it's easier to disable IP restrictions on the `/webhooks/` path.

Edit your `n8n.yaml` file with the policy below.

```yaml
on_http_request:
  - expressions:
      - "req.url.path.contains('/webhook/$WORKFLOW_UUID')"
    actions:
      - type: verify-webhook
        config:
          provider: github
          secret: $SECRET

  - expressions:
      - "!req.url.path.contains('/webhook/')"
    actions:
      - type: restrict-ips
        config:
          enforce: true
          allow:
            - "$YOUR_IP/32"
```

**What's happening here?** This policy first verifies any incoming webhooks as before. Then, the policy applies IP restrictions to only traffic _not_ to the `/webhook/` path, which allows your webhooks provider's request to reach n8n successfully.
