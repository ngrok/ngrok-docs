ngrok works out of the box with any up-to-date Wordpress installation where you have access to the host machine's terminal and filesystem.

ngrok improves your existing Wordpress installation by:

- Managing and auto-renewing your TLS certificates
- Distributing and accelerating your blog on a global content delivery network
- Protecting your blog from DDoS attacks with our firewall

## 1. Reserve a domain

<ReserveDomain domain="https://your-blog.ngrok.app" />

## 2. Create a Traffic Policy file

On the system where Wordpress runs, create a file named `wordpress.yaml` and paste in the following policy:

```yaml
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: add-headers
        config:
          headers:
            host: localhost
```

### What's happening here?

Traffic Policy rewrites the `Host` header of every HTTP request to `localhost` so that Wordpress accepts the requests.

## 3. Start your Wordpress endpoint

On the same system where Wordpress runs, start the agent on port `80`, which is the default for Wordpress, and referencing the `wordpress.yaml` file you just created.

```bash
ngrok http 80 --url https://your-service.ngrok.app --traffic-policy-file wordpress.yaml
```

## 4. Restrict access to the admin dashboard (optional)

The WP Admin dashboard is protected by a username and password, but is often subjected to attacks.
You can use the [`restrict-ips` Traffic Policy action](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/restrict-ips/) to allow only yours or other trusted IPs.

Edit your `wordpress.yaml` file with the following policy, replacing `$YOUR_IP`.

```yaml
on_http_request:
  - expressions:
      - "req.url.includes('/wp-admin')"
    actions:
      - type: restrict-ips
        config:
          enforce: true
          allow:
            - $YOUR_IP/32

  - actions:
      - type: add-headers
        config:
          headers:
            host: localhost
```

### What's happening here?

Traffic Policy first checks whether an HTTP request's URL contains the `/wp-admin` path. If it does, then it applies the `restrict-ips` action to allow only the addresses you explicitly added.

Then, as before, Traffic Policy rewrites the `Host` header of every HTTP request to `localhost` so that Wordpress accepts the requests.

## 5. Try out your endpoint!

- In your browser: https://your-blog.ngrok.app
- In your terminal: `curl https://your-blog.ngrok.app`

## What's next?

- Read more about [Traffic Policy](/docs/traffic-policy) and its [core concepts](/docs/traffic-policy/concepts).
- View your Wordpress traffic in [Traffic Inspector](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/traffic-inspector).
- Use the [`rewrite` action](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/redirect) to create ["pretty" blog URLs](/docs/traffic-policy/examples/url-rewrites/).
