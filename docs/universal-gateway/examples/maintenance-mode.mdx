Whenever you're making infrastructure changes, a major upgrade to your services during planned downtime, or experiencing an incident, you still want to maintain a public-facing presence on your endpoints to tell customers what's going on.

With ngrok, you can use Traffic Policy and the [`custom-response`](https://ngrok.com/docs/traffic-policy/actions/custom-response/) action to immediately deploy a consistent maintenance message without needing to spin up a new backend service or change DNS records to point to an third-party app.

## 1. Create an endpoint for your service

Start an internal [Agent Endpoint](/docs/universal-gateway/agent-endpoints/), replacing `$PORT` based on where your service listens.
You can also use one of our [SDKs](/docs/agent-sdks) or the [Kubernetes Operator](/docs/k8s).

```bash
ngrok http $PORT --url https://service.internal
```

## 2. Reserve a domain

<ReserveDomain />

## 3. Create a Cloud Endpoint

<CloudEndpoint />

## 4. Create a maintenance page on your Cloud Endpoint with Traffic Policy

Copy and paste the policy below into your new Cloud Endpoint in the ngrok dashboard.

```yaml
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: custom-response
        config:
          body: "We're currently undergoing maintenance. Please check back later!"
  - actions:
      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: https://service.internal
```

### What's happening here?

Traffic Policy "interrupts" every request by providing a custom response containing your maintenance message.

When your maintenance window is over and you're ready to route traffic to your upstream service, remove or comment out the `custom-response` action.

```yaml
on_http_request:
  #- actions:
  #    - type: custom-response
  #      config:
  #        body: "We're currently undergoing maintenance. Please check back later!"
  - actions:
      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: https://service.internal
```

## 5. Try out your endpoint

<TryOut />
