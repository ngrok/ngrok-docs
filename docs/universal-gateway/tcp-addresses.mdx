# TCP Addresses

## Overview

TCP Addresses enable you to create public [TCP
Endpoints](/universal-gateway/endpoints/tcp/) on a fixed address. TCP Addresses
are a host and port tuple, for example `1.tcp.eu.ngrok.io:12345`.

You can manage TCP Addresses on your [ngrok
Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/tcp-addresses) or via the [ngrok
API](#api).

## Public endpoint creation

A TCP Address's primary responsibility is to enable you to create public TCP
endpoints with a hostname and port matching the address. These are called
"matching endpoints". For example, after you create the TCP Address
`1.tcp.jp.ngrok.io:12345`, you can create the Endpoint
`tcp://1.tcp.jp.ngrok.io:12345`.

Only TCP endpoints may be created on TCP Addresses. To create other endpoint
types, create a [Domain](/universal-gateway/domains/).

## Address assignment

The hostname and port of the TCP Address are randomly assigned when you create
it, after which it will not change. You may not choose the hostname or port.
The port of your TCP address is uniquely assigned to your account, but other
ports on that same hostname may be assigned to other accounts. While the
hostname and port of a TCP Address is fixed, they do not have static IPs.

## Global Load Balancer

TCP Addresses are not supported by the [global load
balancer](/universal-gateway/network/global-load-balancer).

You must select a [Point of
Presence](/universal-gateway/network/points-of-presence) when you create a TCP
Address. Connections to matching TCP Endpoints on a TCP Address will always
route to the TCP Address's point of presence, no matter where those connections
originated in the world.

You may create Agent Endpoints from an agent connected to a different point of
presence than the matching TCP Address. For example, the following will work
properly:

```sh
ngrok tcp 3389 --region jp --url tcp://1.tcp.eu.ngrok.io:12345
```

## API

TCP Addresses are programatically managed via:

- [`/reserved_addrs` API Resource](/api/resources/reserved-addrs/)

## Pricing

TCP Addresses are available on paid plans only, they are not available on the
free plan.
