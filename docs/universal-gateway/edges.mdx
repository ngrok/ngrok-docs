# Edges

## Deprecation

::::warning
Edges, Routes, Modules, Backends and Labeled Tunnels are deprecated. See the [Migration Guide](#migration-guide).
::::

### Sunset Date

There is no planned date when Edges will be sunset and turned off.

Edges are still supported and continue to work as-is. When a date is chosen, it
will be communicated to all Edges users.

### Migration Guide

We've replaced Edges with new features which are both simpler and more powerful
than their Edges counterparts. Use the following replacement guide to migrate
off of Edges:

## Overview

Edges are a way to create persistent, centrally managed endpoints via the ngrok
dashboard or API. Edges enable you to centrally manage your endpoints in the
ngrok dashboard or API instead of defining behaviors at the [Agent](/agent/) or
[Agent SDK](/agent-sdks).

With Edges, you start your agent once with labeled tunnels and then configure
the Edge via the dashboard or API. When you make changes to your Edge's
configuration by adding or updating modules, your app doesnâ€™t go offline. You
never have to restart the agent to pick up new command line flags or
configuration files.

Edges enable you to:

- Enhance your endpoints with [Modules](#modules) using the dashboard or API
  without restarting the Agent.
- Centrally manage your module configurations in ngrok's cloud service. This
  decouples the configuration of module behavior on your endpoint from the agents
  where traffic is routed to.
- Load balance traffic to different ngrok agents
- Apply different configurations for each path in your application. For
  example, you may apply OAuth on `/app` and Compression on `/static/css`.

### Concepts

The Edges system includes the following concepts:

- **Edges** - there are separate Edge types for each protocol: HTTPS, TCP, and TLS.
- **Routes** - HTTPS Edges have one or more Routes which receive traffic based on a URL path prefix selector.
- **Modules** - Edges and Routes have zero or more Modules which transform and authenticate traffic on that Edge/Route.
- **Backends** - Routes and Edges send traffic to a Backend to be handled after it has been processed by the Modules. Backends send traffic to Labeled Tunnels or other Backends.
- **Labeled Tunnels** - Tunnel Group Backends send traffic to labeled tunnels that have been started by agents.

## Modules

Modules are a type of middleware that enable you to manipulate traffic to your applications.
Modules can provide authentication, resiliency, acceleration, transformation,
security and observability to the traffic that transits through ngrok to your upstream
applications.

## Backends

After traffic to an Edge has been processed by the Modules, it is sent to a
Backend. A Backend is the last middleware to be applied to your traffic
and it determines where the traffic is sent. There are multiple types of
Backends, each with different behaviors.

### Tunnel Group

Tunnel Group backends allow you to load balance traffic equally among multiple
ngrok agents. Tunnel Group backends define a _label selector_. A Tunnel Group
backend will balance traffic among all ngrok tunnels whose labels match its
label selector.

For example, if your Tunnel Group has a label selector of `app=dashboard, version=1`:

- A tunnel with the labels `app=dashboard, version=1` will match
- A tunnel with the labels `app=dashboard, version=1, color=blue` will match.
- A tunnel with the labels `app=api, version=1` will not match.

Agents and Agent SDKs can start labeled tunnels. Using our previous example of
a tunnel group with the label selector of `app=dashboard, version=1`, you can
start a matching tunnel with:

```bash
ngrok tunnel 80 --label="app=dashboard,version=1"
```

Consult the documentation of the [`ngrok tunnel` command in the ngrok
agent](/agent/cli#ngrok-tunnel) for additional details.

When used with HTTPS edges, balancing among tunnels is distributed on a
per-request basis.

When used with TLS or TCP edges, balancing among tunnels is distributed on a
per-connection basis.

### HTTP Response

HTTP Response backends return a fixed HTTP response with a status code, header
and body text that you configure. HTTP Response backends are useful to:

- Render customized error pages like 503 when used as part of a failover
  backend
- Redirect traffic with a 30X redirect response for a Route that it is set on

### Failover

Failover backends define multiple other backends to try in order. The first
backend that succeeds will be used. A backend 'fails' only if it cannot be
dialed. If a connection is established or an HTTP request is sent to a backend,
no failover will occur, even if the backend fails to respond or responds with
an error.

### Weighted

Weighted backends will distribute traffic to one or more backends proportional
to the `weight` for each of its backends. Weighted backends are useful for:

- Canary deploys where you want to distribute a small percentage of traffic to
  new backends
- Gradual rollout deployments where traffic is slowly migrated from the
  previous version of an upstream service to a newer version
- A/B testing different versions of the same service

When used with HTTPS edges, balancing among child backends is distributed on a
per-request basis.

When used with TLS or TCP edges, balancing among child backends is distributed
on a per-connection basis.

## HTTPS

### HTTPS Edges

- An HTTPS Edge is attached to one or more Domains. For each Domain, it creates
  an [Endpoint](/universal-gateway/endpoints/) that it listens for traffic on.
- When a Domain is associated with an HTTPS edge, agents may no longer start
  endpoints on that Domain. You can always detach a Domain from your Edge if you want
  to create Endpoints on it from an Agent or Agent SDK.
- An HTTPS Edge has one or more Routes. Routes have selectors which enable you
  to process traffic for paths like `/app` or `/static` differently.
- Each Route can apply different Modules. Routes can also even send traffic to
  different Backends.
- HTTPS Edges do not create a corresponding HTTP endpoint. Instead, all HTTP
  traffic to domains associated with your HTTPS edges is automatically redirected
  to HTTPS.
- When you create an HTTPS Edge via the dashboard, it will automatically create
  a new Domain with a random name and assign it to your Edge. If you are on the
  free plan and have created your free domain, it will adopt that domain.
- When you create an HTTPS Edge via the dashboard, it will automatically create
  a Failover Backend with two entries. First, a tunnel group backend with a
  unique label and second an HTTP Response backend which renders an error if
  there are no tunnels online in the tunnel group.

### HTTPS Modules

Use modules to modify the behavior of traffic flowing through your endpoints.

| Module                                                                               | Description                                                                                                    |

### HTTPS Routes

When you use Edges to manage your endpoints, you can apply different
modules on a per-path basis. For example, you could apply auth to `/dashboard`
and compression to `/static`.

We call this primitive a Route. Each Route is defined using a path selector,
which will match a path on the request to that endpoint. This can be useful for
adding OAuth to specific areas of your website, or stitching multiple services
together into a single website. Routes can share the same backend, or you can
use a different backend for each route.

## TLS

### TLS Edges

- A TLS Edge is attached to one or more Domains. For each Domain, it creates
  a TLS Endpoint that it listens for traffic on.
- When a Domain is associated with a TLS Edge, agents may no longer start
  endpoints on that Domain. You can always detach a Domain from your Edge if you
  want to create Endpoints on it from an Agent or Agent SDK.
- Modules on a TLS Edge are attached directly to the edge itself. There are no
  Routes.
- When you create a TLS Edge via the dashboard, it will automatically create a
  new Domain with a random name and assign it to your Edge.
- When you create an TLS Edge via the dashboard, it will automatically create
  a [Tunnel Group Backend](/universal-gateway/edges/#tunnel-group) with a unique label.

### TLS Modules

Use modules to modify the behavior of traffic flowing through your endpoints.

| Module                                                            | Description                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Mutual TLS](/api/resources/tls-edge-mutual-tls-module/)          | Perform mutual TLS authentication when terminating TLS connections with a configured set of certificate authorities. |
| [TLS](/api/resources/tls-edge-tls-termination-module/)            | Configure whether ngrok terminates TLS traffic at its edge or forwards the TLS traffic through unterminated.         |
| [IP Restrictions](/api/resources/tls-edge-traffic-policy-module/) | Allow or deny traffic based on the source IP of connections                                                          |
| [Traffic Policy](/api/resources/tls-edge-traffic-policy-module/)  | Influence and control traffic to and from your upstream service by configuring a powerful policy engine.             |

## TCP

### TCP Edges

[Edges](/universal-gateway/edges) enable you to centrally manage your endpoints'
Module configurations in the ngrok dashboard or API instead of defining them
via an Agent or Agent SDK.

- A TCP Edge is attached to one or more TCP Addresses. For each TCP Address, it creates
  a TCP Endpoint that it listens for traffic on.
- When a TCP Address is associated with a TCP Edge, agents may no longer start
  endpoints on that TCP Address. You can always detach a TCP Address from your
  Edge if you want to create Endpoints on it from an Agent or Agent SDK.
- Modules on a TCP Edge are attached directly to the edge itself. There are no
  Routes.
- When you create a TCP Edge via the dashboard, it will automatically create a
  new TCP Address assign it to your Edge.
- When you create a TCP Edge via the dashboard, it will automatically create a
  tunnel group backend with a unique label.

### TCP Modules

Use modules to modify the behavior of traffic flowing through your endpoints.

| Module                                                            | Description                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [IP Restrictions](/api/resources/tcp-edge-ip-restriction-module/) | Allow or deny traffic based on the source IP of connections                                              |
| [Traffic Policy](/api/resources/tcp-edge-traffic-policy-module/)  | Influence and control traffic to and from your upstream service by configuring a powerful policy engine. |
