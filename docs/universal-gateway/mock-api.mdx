title: How Do I Mock API Endpoints?

You can mock API responses using ngrok Endpoints. This enables you to test your application's functionality without having to stand up a full backend service or make requests to real APIs.

The following steps will walk you through using [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/) to mock API responses.

## 1. Create a Traffic Policy

When requests are made to an Endpoint with a Traffic Policy, the policy can execute certain actions before returning a response or forwarding the traffic to downstream services. Using [request variables](/docs/traffic-policy/variables/req/), you can check many aspects of a request before sending a response, such as the value of its headers, the scheme, the user agent, and more.

The following example Traffic Policy checks the URL path of all incoming requests, then returns a custom response if the path matches `/api/example`:

<ConfigExample
	snippetText={null}
	showLineNumbers={true}
	jsonMetastring="{8-17}"
	yamlMetastring="{6-12}"
	config={{
		on_http_request: [
			{
				expressions: ["req.url.path == '/api/example'"],
				actions: [
					{
						type: "custom-response",
						config: {
							status_code: 503,
							content: '{"hello":"world"}',
							headers: {
								"content-type": "application/json",
							},
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>

## 2. Apply the Traffic Policy to an Endpoint

There are multiple ways to apply the Traffic Policy from the previous section to your Endpoints. How you should do so depends on the type of Endpoint you're using.

### Agent Endpoints

<Tabs groupId="agent-endpoint-option" queryString="ceo1">
	<TabItem value="cli-flags" label="With CLI flags">

Run the following terminal command to create an Agent Endpoint with a Traffic Policy file:

```bash
		ngrok http 8080 --traffic-policy "policy-file-here.yml"
```

See [the guide on using Traffic Policy with CLI flags](/docs/traffic-policy/getting-started/agent-endpoints/cli/) for more information.

</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="config-file" label="With a configuration file">

Use the following terminal command to edit your ngrok config file:

```bash
ngrok config edit
```

See [the guide on using Traffic Policy with a config file](/docs/traffic-policy/getting-started/agent-endpoints/config-file/) for more information.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Cloud Endpoints

<Tabs groupId="cloud-endpoint-option" queryString="ceo1">
	<TabItem value="dashboard" label="Dashboard">
	
	1. Navigate to the [Endpoints](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/endpoints/) page.
	1. Select the Cloud Endpoint you want to use. You'll be taken to a page where you can edit the Traffic Policy directly.

  </TabItem>
	<TabItem value="cli-api" label="ngrok CLI">
	With the ngrok CLI `api` command, you can add a Traffic Policy file to your Cloud Endpoint with the following command options:
  ```bash
  ngrok api endpoints create \
  --url https://<your-reserve-domain> \
  --traffic-policy "policy-file-here.yml"
  ```
  See [the guide on using Traffic Policy with Cloud Endpoints](/docs/traffic-policy/getting-started/cloud-endpoints/api/) for more information.
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## 3. Test the Traffic Policy

To test the Traffic Policy defined in this guide, send a request to your endpoint like this:

```shell
$ curl https://example.ngrok.app/api/example
```

The response should look like this:

```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
content-type: application/json

{
  "hello": "world"
}
```
