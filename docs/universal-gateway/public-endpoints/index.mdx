title: What are Public Endpoints?
description: Learn about enabling internet traffic to your services with public endpoints.
---

Public endpoints enable your services to receive geo-balanced internet traffic using [ngrok's global points of presence](/docs/universal-gateway/edges/). This is the most common type of endpoint and the easiest way to start.

[Public endpoint URLs](/docs/universal-gateway/what-are-endpoint-urls/) must:

- Use either a [Domain](/universal-gateway/domains/what-are-domains/) or [TCP Address](/universal-gateway/tcp-addresses/)
- Use the `public` [binding](/docs/universal-gateway/bindings/)

## Get started

You can create a public endpoint using:

- [The dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/endpoints)
- [The API](/docs/api/resources/endpoints/#create-endpoint).

Follow the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/) guide to set up an ngrok account and create your first public endpoint.

## Authentication

Public endpoints are useful out of the box for content you don't want to restrict access to, such as blogs or marketing sites; but they can also be used for services that require strict access control such as dashboards or private APIs.

To keep such services both public and secure, you can add a Traffic Policy to your endpoint for authentication and authorization. Traffic Policy actions enable you to do the following with your endpoints:

- [JWT Validation](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/jwt-validation/)
- [OAuth](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/oauth/)
- [OIDC](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/oidc/)
- [IP restrictions](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/restrict-ips/)
- [Mutual TLS](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/terminate-tls/#example-traffic-policy-document)

## Matching endpoints

A matching endpoint is a public endpoint with a [hostname](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname.) matching a [Domain](/universal-gateway/what-are-domains) or [TCP Address](/universal-gateway/) you've configured with ngrok.

Matching endpoints are subject to the following restrictions:

| Endpoint Protocol | Required Port |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| `http`            | `80`          |
| `https`           | `443`         |
| `tls`             | `443`         |
| `tcp`             | Any           |

## API

Public endpoints can be created programatically. Consult the documentation on
[Endpoint APIs](/api/resources/endpoints/).

## Pricing

Public endpoints are available on all plans. Consult the [Endpoints
Pricing](/universal-gateway/endpoints/#pricing) documentation for
billing details.
