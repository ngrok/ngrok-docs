An **ngrok Endpoint** is a URL that enables network traffic to reach your services.

You can think of endpoints as a gateway to anything you want to enable access for—whether that's a local development server on your laptop, a production Kubernetes cluster, a database behind a corporate firewall, or a cloud API. Endpoints bridge the gap between your resources and the traffic that needs to reach them.

## Why endpoints matter

Endpoints are ngrok's universal gateways, letting you:

- **Go live instantly**: Enable access to local prototypes, internal tools or [Kubernetes](/universal-gateway/kubernetes-endpoints/) services in seconds.
- **Talk to anything**: APIs, Kubernetes clusters, game servers, third-party tools, IoT devices, legacy apps—endpoints support them all.
- **Secure access**: Effortlessly lock down access with encryption, authentication, or IP restrictions to whatever you need without code changes.
- **Observability:** Instantly gain insights into how traffic is flowing through endpoints with our Traffic Inspector and Event Logging.
- **Simplify your stack**: Reduce infrastructure sprawl by chaining endpoints and embedding logic directly into traffic flow—rate limiting, mock responses, or security policies, executed at the edge with no code required.

## How endpoints work

Endpoints enable traffic flow and management through three core features:

- **URL:** The entry point for traffic to reach your services. This could be any URL, such as `https://your-app.ngrok.io` or `tcp://your-api.internal`.
- **[Binding](#control-access-with-bindings):** The source or origin of incoming traffic.
- **[Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/):** Configuration to manage, manipulate and secure traffic.

### Control Access with Bindings

An endpoint's [binding](/universal-gateway/bindings) defines _where traffic originates_:

- **Public:** Accepts traffic from the open internet (e.g. `https://your-app.ngrok.io`).
- **Internal:** Restricted to accept traffic only through the [`forward-internal` Traffic Policy action](/traffic-policy/actions/forward-internal/) (e.g. `http://your-api.internal`).
- **[Kubernetes](/k8s/):** Restricted to accept traffic only from Kubernetes clusters using the ngrok Kubernetes Operator.

### Set Protocol via URL Scheme

You can specify your endpoint's URL protocol to indicate the type of traffic it should handle. This allows you to configure your endpoint to match your services and application type:

- `HTTP/HTTPS`: Best for Webhooks, APIs, apps
- `TCP`: Best for raw streams (SSH, gaming, IoT)
- `TLS`: Best for custom encrypted workloads

### Manage, manipulate and secure traffic through policies

Add business logic and route traffic during the request lifecycle with [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/):

- **Route traffic by anything:** Paths, headers or any other available variable.
- **Manipulate traffic through [actions](/traffic-policy/actions/):** Redirect urls, inject headers or send custom responses.
- **Secure:** Add [OAuth](/traffic-policy/actions/oauth/), [IP restrictions](/traffic-policy/actions/restrict-ips) or [mutual TLS](/traffic-policy/actions/terminate-tls/#enabling-mutual-tls).

### Deliver traffic anywhere

You can host endpoints on your local machine with the [ngrok Agent](/agent/) or in the cloud with [ngrok Cloud Endpoints](/universal-gateway/cloud-endpoints/).

See [Cloud Endpoints vs Agent Endpoints](/universal-gateway/types#cloud-endpoints-vs-agent-endpoints) for a side-by-side comparison.

## Get started

Enable access to a local web app on port `8080` with the [ngrok CLI](/agent/cli):

```bash
ngrok http 8080
```

This command will start an Agent Endpoint that forwards traffic through the ngrok CLI agent to your locally running application on port 8080.

To learn more, follow ngrok's [Quickstart](/getting-started/).

## Load balancing with Endpoint Pooling

[Endpoint Pooling](/universal-gateway/endpoint-pooling) allows you to create multiple endpoints with the same URL. Traffic sent to a URL with an Endpoint Pool is [load-balanced](/docs/universal-gateway/global-load-balancer/) among the Endpoints in the pool.

See the [Endpoint Pooling quickstart](/universal-gateway/endpoint-pooling/#quickstart) to learn more.

## Managing endpoints with ngrok's APIs

[Cloud Endpoints](/universal-gateway/cloud-endpoints/) are
programatically managed via:

- [`/endpoints` API Resource](/api/resources/endpoints/) of the [API](/api/)
- [`CloudEndpoint` CRD](/k8s/crds/) of the [Kubernetes Operator](/k8s/)

[Agent Endpoints](/universal-gateway/agent-endpoints), by contrast,
are programtically managed via:

- [Agent SDKs](/agent-sdks/)
- [Agent API](/agent/api/)
- [Kubernetes Operator](/k8s/installation/install)

Agent Endpoints are also accessible in a read-only capacity via:

- [`/endpoints` API Resource](/api/resources/endpoints/#list-endpoints) of the [API](/api)

## Pricing

Paid plans (Personal, Pro and Enterprise) include a fixed number of
endpoints that you may create based on the number of licenses you have
purchased.

On the Pay-as-you-go plan, there is no limit on the number of endpoints you can create. An endpoint that transmits data in a billing period is counted as an active endpoint for billing purposes.

See [Pricing](https://ngrok.com/pricing) for more information.

## Learn more

- **[Cloud Endpoints](/universal-gateway/cloud-endpoints):** Create always-on endpoints to deliver and manage traffic to custom responses, internal endpoints or third-party services.
  - Great for centralized configuration and routing across multiple services and handling failover when your upstream applications and services are offline.
- **[Agent Endpoints](/universal-gateway/agent-endpoints):** Create an endpoint that only exists as long the agent is running to deliver and manage traffic to your local applications, files, services or third-party services.
  - Great for load balancing and managing individual APIs, services, applications, devices and forwarding traffic to third-party destinations.
