# TLS Certificates

ngrok automatically handles TLS (SSL) certificate management and termination
for you. There is typically nothing to setup, configure or manage.

You can manage TLS certificates on your [ngrok
dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/tls-certs) or via the [ngrok API](#api).

## Overview

TLS certificates are a tuple of a private key and certificate that are
presented by the ngrok cloud service during a TLS handshakes to terminate TLS
connections to [HTTPS endpoints](/universal-gateway/http) and [TLS
endpoints](/universal-gateway/tls). TLS certificates are attached to
[domains](/universal-gateway/domains/) for termination of TLS connections to
endpoints whose URLs match that domain. ngrok can automatically provision
certificates for you or you can upload your own.

See the [TLS Termination](/universal-gateway/tls-termination/)
documentation for details on how and when ngrok terminates TLS connections.

## Certificate Selection

When TLS connections to an endpoint are terminated, ngrok uses the TLS
Certificate attached to the [domain](/universal-gateway/domains) matching the
endpoint's URL for termination.

Each [domain](/universal-gateway/domains/) has an attached TLS certificate that
is referenced by its [`certificate_id` field](/api/resources/reserved-domains).
If the domain object does reference any certificate, or if there is no matching
domain object for an endpoint's URL, ngrok selects its own TLS certificate for
termination.

You may override the certificate used for TLS termination by explicitly
terminating TLS yourself with the [`terminate-tls` traffic policy
action](/traffic-policy/actions/terminate-tls/).

## Certificate Provisioning

Whenever you create a [domain](/universal-gateway/domains/) you choose how
a TLS certificate will be provisioned. Either:

- [Automatic TLS certificates](#automated) (default) - ngrok automatically
  provisions a TLS certificate from an ACME provider like Let's Encrypt.
- [Bring your own TLS certificates](#custom) - Upload your own TLS certificate

It is recommended that you choose automatic TLS certificates unless you have
special requirements.

## Automatic Provisioning {#automated}

When you choose automatic TLS certificate management for a domain (this is the
default), ngrok automatically provisions **and renews** TLS certificates from
an ACME-compliant certificate authority like Let's Encrypt.

ngrok uses an HTTP01 challenge for TLS certificate provisioning of most
domains. When you create a [wildcard domain](#wildcard-domains) ngrok uses a
DNS01 challenge instead.

ngrok is a [Let's Encrypt sponsor](https://letsencrypt.org/sponsors/).

### Status

TLS certificates are provisioned asynchronously. Depending on the speed of the
ACME certificate authority, it can take anywhere between a few seconds to 10
minutes for your certificate to be provisioned. The domain's
`certificate_management_status` field on the [TLS Certificate API
Resource](/api/resources/tls-certificates/) contains the status of the
provisioning job.

### Bring your own domain

When you [bring your own domain](/universal-gateway/domains/#branded-domains)
(e.g. `api.your-domain.com`) you must create a CNAME DNS record in your DNS
provider. Certificate provisioning will not begin until your create this CNAME
DNS record.

### Wildcard Domains

When you bring your own wildcard domain (e.g. `*.app.example.com`), ngrok uses
a DNS01 challenge for TLS certificate provisioning which means that you must
create two CNAME records when creating branded wildcard domains instead of just
one.

For example, If your domain is `*.app.example.com` you will be required to create the
following two CNAME records:

- `*.app.example.com`
- `_acme-challenge.app.example.com`

Certificate provisioning will not begin until you have created both DNS
records.

### Private Keys

When using automatic TLS certificates, ngrok generates a private key for your
domain and encrypts it at rest with with [NaCL](https://nacl.cr.yp.to/).

When you configure a domain to use automated certificates, you may electively
choose whether ngrok will create an ECDSA private key (the default) or RSA
private key. If you choose an RSA private key, it is created with a size of
4096 bits.

## Bring your own certificates {#custom}

You may upload your own TLS certificates if you don't want to use the TLS
certificates that ngrok automatically provisions for you. Uploading your own
certificates may be the right choice if you are issuing certificates from your
own certificate authority or if you are using an EV certificate.

To bring your own TLS certificate, upload a [certificate
bundle](#certificate-bundles) and a [private key](#private-keys). Keep in mind
that after you create your TLS certificate, you must attach it to one or more
domains before it will be used for termination. When working with the API, this
is done by updating the `certificate_id` property of the [Domain API
Resource](/api/resources/reserved-domains).

Unlike automatic TLS certificates, when you are using custom TLS certificates,
you are responsible for managing the renewal and rotation of new certificates.

### Certificate Bundles {#certificate-bundles}

When uploading your own TLS certificates to ngrok, you are expected to provide
a certificate bundle of all certificates necessary to establish a chain of
trust to a trusted root certificate authority. Many TLS certificate vendors
will provide you with a constructed certificate bundle, but some will return
the leaf certificate and the intermediate certificates separately and you must
concatenate them to construct the bundle yourself. This is the
`certificate_pem` field in the [TLS Certificate Create
API](/api/resources/tls-certificates/).

Certificate bundles are a series of PEM-encoded X.509 certificates that have
been concatenated together. **The order of this bundle is significant.**

The first certificate in the bundle must be the leaf certificate. The leaf
certificate is the one which is signed for your domain and [the private
key](#private-keys) you will upload.

After the leaf certificate are the intermediates certificates, if any. Each
intermediate certificate signs the certificate preceding it in the bundle. As
an example, the first intermediate will sign the leaf, and that signature is
part of the leaf certificate itself. The final certificate will be signed by
the root certificate authority. You may also included the root certificate in
the bundle as well, but it is not necessary or common practice to do so.

A certificate bundle will look like the following:

```pem
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

### Private Keys {#private-keys}

ngrok accepts the following formats for the private key of an uploaded TLS
certificate. This is the `private_key_pem` field in the [TLS Certificate Create
API](/api/resources/tls-certificates/).

- RSA, in either PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 form.
- ECDSA, in either SEC 1 or PKCS#8 form.
- Ed25519, in PKCS#8 form.

Regardless of the format you choose, the private key must be formatted as ASN.1
DER, encoded as PEM. ngrok will not accept any private keys that are encrypted
(e.g. with DES).

ngrok encrypts your uploaded private keys at rest with
[NaCL](https://nacl.cr.yp.to/).

## API

TLS certificates are managed programatically via:

- [`/tls_certificates` API Resource](/api/resources/tls-certificates/)

## Pricing

TLS certificates are available on all plans. Bringing your own certificates is
available on the Enterprise plan.
