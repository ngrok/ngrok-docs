title: Using TCP Addresses
description: Learn how to use TCP Addresses with ngrok.
---

[TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) Addresses enable you to create public [TCP Endpoints](/universal-gateway/tcp/) on static addresses. All TCP Addresses contain both their hostname and port, such as `1.tcp.eu.ngrok.io:12345`.

You can manage TCP Addresses with:

- [The Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/tcp-addresses)
  - Learn [how TCP Addresses are assigned](/universal-gateway/tcp-addresses/how-are-tcp-addresses-assigned/).
- [The API](/api/resources/reserved-addrs/).

:::note
Only TCP Endpoints may be created on TCP Addresses. For other endpoint
types, create a [Domain](/universal-gateway/domains/what-are-domains/).

## TCP address load balancing

Global load balancing is not supported for TCP Addresses. See the [Load Balancing documentation](/universal-gateway/global-load-balancer/#gslb-for-tcp-endpoints) for more information.

## Pricing

TCP Addresses are available on paid plans only, they are not available on the
free plan. See [the pricing page](https://ngrok.com/pricing) for more information.
