title: How Does ngrok TLS Termination Work?
description: Learn how ngrok's TLS termination works.
---

ngrok's TLS termination behavior is determined by an endpoint's protocol and traffic policy. You may customize each endpoint to choose where TLS is terminated, how it is terminated and even whether it is terminated at all. When ngrok's cloud service terminates TLS, it:

- Uses the latest and most secure version of TLS
- Uses the [TLS
  Certificate](/universal-gateway/tls-certificates/how-does-ngrok-handle-tls/) attached to the
  [Domain](/universal-gateway/domains/what-are-domains/) which matches the Endpoint URL's
  hostname
- Accelerates your traffic by using the global load balancer to terminate at its
  closest point of presence

:::info
ngrok supports end-to-end encryption, which enables you to encrypt traffic between visitors and your upstream services so the ngrok cloud service can't access it. See the docs on [how TLS termination works](#end-to-end-encryption) to learn more.

## Acceleration

The ngrok cloud service improves the performance of your endpoints by
accelerating TLS termination using ngrok's [global points
of presence](/universal-gateway/points-of-presence).

TLS connection set-up requires multiple network round-trips. When round-trip
times (RTTs) are long, TLS connection establishment slows down. ngrok reduces
the latency of these round-trip times between the client and your endpoint by
terminating connections at the closest [point of
presence](/universal-gateway/points-of-presence/) via its [global load
balancer](/universal-gateway/global-load-balancer).

## FIPS Compliance

ngrok does not use a [FIPS-compliant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIPS_140-2) TLS implementation by default, but one can
be enabled for your endpoints.

[Contact us](mailto:support@ngrok.com) if you require a FIPS-compliant TLS
implementation.

## End-to-end encryption

You may choose to terminate TLS at your upstream service or at the ngrok agent
to achieve end-to-end encryption (E2EE), often referred to as Zero-knowledge TLS. When your endpoints operate in this
mode, the ngrok cloud service can not see the payloads that transfer through
your endpoints.

Creating an endpoint with end-to-end encryption is simple:

- Create a TLS or TCP endpoint
- **Do not** add a `terminate-tls` action to its traffic policy.

That's it! Read the [Agent TLS Termination
Guide](/agent/agent-tls-termination/) for a step by step approach to set it up.

To set up the agent to terminate TLS for you, consult the following table
because the configuration depends on which kind of agent you are using.
