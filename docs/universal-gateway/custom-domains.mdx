description: Learn how to use your own custom domain with ngrok.
---

This guide will show you the steps to use any domain name that you already own with ngrok, e.g. `app.your-domain.com`.

:::note
ngrok is not a domain registrar; you must already own a domain name to use it
with ngrok.
:::

## 1. Create a domain in ngrok

You can [create a domain in the ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains).

When your domain is created, you'll be given a `CNAME` value such as `exampledata.otherdata.ngrok-cname.com`. Copy it.

:::info
You can also create a Domain via the [ngrok API](/api/resources/reserved-domains/#request). The `CNAME` will be in the `"cname_target"` field of [the response object](/api/resources/reserved-domains/#response).
:::

## 2. Add the CNAME record to your domain

1. In a new browser tab, navigate to your domain hosting provider's dashboard and create a CNAME record. Check your hosting provider's support content or documentation to learn how.
   - Typically, this process includes creating a [DNS record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types).
2. When configuring the record, use the following values:
   - Its **type** should be `CNAME`
   - Its **name** should be `@`
   - Its **value** should be the `CNAME` value you copied from the ngrok dashboard or API response.

:::tip Test your CNAME record
Using a tool like [`dig`](https://www.digwebinterface.com/) or [`nslookup`](https://www.nslookup.io/), you can test your CNAME record in the terminal.
:::

## 3. Start an endpoint using your domain:

To start an agent endpoint at your domain, run the following command in your terminal, replacing `your-domain-here.example.com` with the domain you created in the ngrok dashboard.
`bash
	ngrok http --url your-domain-here.example.com 8080
	`

## Wildcard domains

If you bring your own [wildcard domain](/universal-gateway/domains#wildcard-domains), e.g. `*.example.com`, you will need to create a second `CNAME` record with your domain host for [wildcard TLS Certificate provisioning](/universal-gateway/tls-certificates/#wildcard-domains).

## Apex domains

Because it's not possible to create `CNAME` records for apex domains, if you want to use an apex domain, e.g. `example.com`, you must use a DNS provider that supports an `ALIAS` record or `CNAME` flattening.

Because of how `ALIAS`/`CNAME` flattening is implemented, apex domains will not take advantage of the [Global Load Balancer](/universal-gateway/global-load-balancer/). If you're trying to create your apex domain because you need to create endpoints for multiple subdomains, use a [wildcard domain](#wildcard-domains) instead.

## Using custom domains with TCP endpoints

Public TCP endpoints are assigned randomly on an ngrok-controlled hostname with a randomly-assigned port. You may not choose the hostname and you may not select the port.

You may, however, simulate a customized hostname by creating a `CNAME` record to the hostname of your assigned TCP address. If you do so, be aware that all ports on that hostname, even those provisioned to other accounts will then be available on your domain.

For example if your TCP address is `5.tcp.ngrok.io:12345`, you could create the following `CNAME` record:
 
```bash
CNAME tcp.mydomain.com -> 5.tcp.ngrok.io
```

Then you can access that TCP endpoint with:

```bash
telnet tcp.mydomain.com 12345
```
