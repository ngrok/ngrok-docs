# IP Addresses {#ip-addresses}

ngrok's cloud service uses a dynamic, rotating set of multitenant IPs to serve
your public Endpoints. Endpoint IPs may change frequently **_and without
notice_**. If you hardcode any of ngrok's IPs or rely on DNS answers past their
TTL, your applications **_will break_**.

The information on this page about IPs also applies not only to Endpoint IPs
but also to the IPs used for [Agent Connections](/agent/ingress/), the
Dashboard and the [API](/api/). They each support Dedicated IPs, IPv6 and
Global Load Balancing.

## Dedicated IPs

If you need a static IP for your public endpoints, you may attach static,
[dedicated IPs for Domains](/univseral-gateway/domains/#dedicated-ips). You may
also set up dedicated IPs for [Agent Connect
URLs](/agent/ingress/#dedicated-ips).

[Contact us](mailto:support@ngrok.com) to set up dedicated static IPs.

## IPv6

ngrok's cloud service universally supports IPv6. DNS queries for the hostnames
of its public endpoints return `AAAA` DNS records.

Don't forget that ngrok supports IPv6 when using the [`restrict-ips` Traffic
Policy action](/traffic-policy/restrict-ips/). If you forget to allow IPv6
traffic, you may unintentionally cause connectivity failures if connections to
your Endpoints use IPv6.

## Global Load Balancer

When you resolve Endpoint IPs via DNS, you will receive a partial list of IPs
because ngrok's [global load
balancer](/universal-gateway/global-load-balancer/) will return a different set
of IPs depending on where you are located in the world.

## API

There is no supported API to query ngrok's IPs at this time.
