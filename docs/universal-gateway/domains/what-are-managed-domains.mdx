If you don't [already own a Domain](/universal-gateway/how-do-i-use-my-own-domain) that you want to use with ngrok, you can create a domain that is a subdomain of an ngrok-managed base domain.

| Domain             | Availability                                      | HSTS Global Preload |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `ngrok.app`        | [Paid accounts](https://ngrok.com/pricing)        | Yes                 |
| `ngrok.dev`        | [Paid accounts](https://ngrok.com/pricing)        | Yes                 |
| `ngrok.pizza`      | [Paid accounts](https://ngrok.com/pricing)        | No                  |
| `ngrok-free.app`   | Free accounts                                     | Yes                 |
| `ngrok-free.dev`   | Free accounts                                     | Yes                 |
| `ngrok-free.pizza` | Free accounts (coming soon)                       | No                  |
| `ngrok.io`         | Discontinued and only available to older accounts | No                  |

## Public Suffix List

The ngrok-managed base domains are on the [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/). Browsers use the Public Suffix List to guarantee that cookies from one subdomain cannot be accessed by other subdomains.

## HSTS preload

Some of the ngrok-managed base domains are on the [global HSTS preload list](https://hstspreload.org/), which means modern browsers automatically convert requests to these domains using an `http` scheme to `https`.

If you need to create unencrypted `http` endpoints, you should create them with hostnames that are not on the HSTS Global Preload like `ngrok.io` and
`ngrok.pizza`.

:::tip
ngrok does not prohibit you from creating `http` endpoints with hostnames whose base domain is on the global HSTS preload list. Non-browser clients (like `curl`) can still be used to make unencrypted HTTP requests to them.
