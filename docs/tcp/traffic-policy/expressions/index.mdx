# Overview

Traffic Policy module enables you to filter inbound and outbound traffic with [Common Expression Language (CEL)](https://github.com/google/cel-spec) expressions. Each policy rule expression must evaluate to true in order for
the rule's actions to take effect against traffic.

- [Learn how to write CEL expressions](/docs/tcp/traffic-policy/expressions/writing-guide).

In addition to CEL's [built-in functions and macros](https://github.com/google/cel-spec/blob/master/doc/langdef.md#macros) we provide additional variables and macros:

- [Action Result Variables](/docs/tcp/traffic-policy/expressions/variables#action-result-variables)
- [Connection Variables](/docs/tcp/traffic-policy/expressions/variables#connection-variables)
- [Connection Geo Variables](/docs/tcp/traffic-policy/expressions/variables#connection-geo-variables)
- [Endpoint Variables](/docs/tcp/traffic-policy/expressions/variables#endpoint-variables)
- [Time Variables](/docs/tcp/traffic-policy/expressions/variables#time-variables)
- [List of available macros for TCP](/docs/tcp/traffic-policy/expressions/macros)
