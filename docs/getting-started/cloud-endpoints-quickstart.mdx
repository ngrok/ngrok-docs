Cloud Endpoints provide an additional layer of traffic management above Agent Endpoints and can be used to extend their functionality in several key ways.
Unlike agent endpoints which are ephemeral and run locally, cloud endpoints are persistent and run in the ngrok cloud—as such, they exist indefinitely until deleted.

:::note 
This doc assumes you've already completed the [Agent CLI Quickstart](/getting-started/index)—if not, we highly recommend starting there before continuing here.
:::

Using a Traffic Policy, a cloud endpoint can route traffic to multiple other endpoints based on criteria such as path, header, or IP.
A common use case for this pattern is to create a public cloud endpoint that routes traffic to one or more internal agent endpoints.

This guide walks you through that process using the Agent CLI to interact with the ngrok API.


:::tip
You can create Cloud Endpoints in the ngrok dashboard in the [**Endpoints**](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/endpoints) section.
:::


## What you'll need

- An [ngrok account](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup).
- Your [ngrok auth token](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
- Your [ngrok API key](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/api-keys).

## 1. Reserve your domain

Cloud endpoints require a reserved domain.

To reserve a domain, navigate to the dashboard, visit [the **Domains** section](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains), and select **+ New Domain**.
You can choose a free static domain, or you can use a custom domain you already own.
We'll come back to this in later steps.

## 2. Install the ngrok Agent CLI

If this is your first time using ngrok, run the command that corresponds to your operating system to install the Agent CLI:

<Tabs groupId="os" queryString="os">
<TabItem value="macos" label="Mac OS" default>

```bash
brew install ngrok
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="linux" label="Debian Linux">

```bash
curl -sSL https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com/ngrok.asc \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ngrok.asc >/dev/null \
  && echo "deb https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com buster main" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ngrok.list \
  && sudo apt update \
  && sudo apt install ngrok
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

```bash
choco install ngrok
```

Run this in an administrator command prompt.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Or [follow the direct installation guide](https://download.ngrok.com?tab=download) if you can't use one of the options above.

To test that it's been installed correctly, run the following command in your terminal and confirm that ngrok prints its help text.

```bash
ngrok help
```

## 3. Connect your account

Connect your agent to your ngrok account by providing your auth token as shown below—replace `$YOUR_TOKEN` with the string given to you [in the dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).

```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken $YOUR_TOKEN
```

## 4. Start your app or service

Start up the app or service you'd like to put online.
This is the app that your agent endpoint will forward online traffic to.

If you don't have an app to work with, you can create a minimal app in your language of choice using the following code to set up a basic HTTP server at port `8080`.

<LangSwitcher>

```javascript title="service.js"
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/html' });
    const html = `
    <html>
    <head><title>Test Page</title></head>
    <body><h1>Hello from Node.js HTTP Server!</h1></body>
    </html>
    `;
    res.end(html);
});

const port = 8080;
server.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Serving custom HTML at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

```go title="service.go"
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello from Go HTTP Server!")
}

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/", handler)

	fmt.Println("Starting server at http://localhost:8080")
	err := http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Server failed:", err)
	}
}
```

```python title="service.py"
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer

class MyHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header("Content-type", "text/html")
        self.end_headers()
        html = b"""
        <html>
        <head><title>Test Page</title></head>
        <body><h1>Hello from Python HTTP Server!</h1></body>
        </html>
        """
        self.wfile.write(html)

def run(server_class=HTTPServer, handler_class=MyHandler, port=8080):
    server_address = ('', port)
    httpd = server_class(server_address, handler_class)
    print(f"Serving custom HTML at http://localhost:{port}")
    httpd.serve_forever()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run()
```

</LangSwitcher>

Navigate to the directory where this file is located and start the server.

## 5. Put your app online

Start the ngrok agent by running the following command (replace `8080` if your app is running on a different port).
The optional `--url` flag connects your app to your reserved domain from step 1—replace `$YOUR_DOMAIN` with this.

```bash
ngrok http 8080 --url $YOUR_DOMAIN
```

The agent should print a console UI to your terminal to confirm that it's online and forwarding as intended.
Open the forwarding URL in your browser to see your web application, which is now available over HTTPS with a valid certificate that ngrok automatically manages for you.

## 6. Secure your app

ngrok makes it simple to add authentication to your app by implementing a [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/).
Using the Agent CLI, you can add a traffic policy to your endpoint by editing your ngrok config file, which was automatically created when you provided your auth token in step 3.

Terminate the agent endpoint that you started up in step 5, then run the following command in your terminal to open `ngrok.yml`:

```bash
ngrok config edit
```

You should see a new console UI with your config version and auth token already set.
Below the auth token, paste the following snippet into the editor and then save and exit the config file.
This policy states that whenever an HTTP/S request is made to `$YOUR_DOMAIN`, the agent endpoint should redirect the user to Google OAuth for authentication before proceeding to the app running on port `8080`.

```yaml title="ngrok.yml"
endpoints:
  - name: cli-quickstart
    url: $YOUR_DOMAIN
    traffic_policy:
      on_http_request:
        - actions:
          - type: oauth
            config:
              provider: google
    upstream:
      url: 8080
      protocol: http1
```

:::tip
This example uses ngrok's default Google OAuth application.
To use your own, see [the OAuth Traffic Policy Action documentation](https://ngrok-docs-git-sg-doc-326-agent-endpoints-cli-f7e245-ngrok-dev.vercel.app/docs/traffic-policy/actions/oauth/#google-example).
:::

Now you can start up your endpoint using its name:

```bash
ngrok start cli-quickstart
```

When you visit your public URL you should be prompted to authenticate by logging in with a Google account before you can access your app.

## What's next?

In this guide, you learned how to create an agent endpoint to forward traffic from the internet to an app running on your local device using the ngrok agent CLI.
You were introduced to some of the most common commands you should know, and you implemented a traffic policy, which can be used for many kinds of actions beyond the basic authentication example here.
You also saw how to edit your config file to make your ephemeral endpoints repeatable and scalable by assigning a name you can refer back to with URLs, protocols, and actions already defined.

- If you need to interact with ngrok agent endpoints programmatically, we recommend using one of our Agent SDKs which are available for [JavaScript (Node.js)](/getting-started/javascript/), [Go](/getting-started/go/), [Python](/getting-started/python/), and [Rust](/getting-started/rust/).
- If your use case calls for a centrally managed, always-on endpoint that isn't tied to the ephemeral lifetime of an agent endpoint, you should proceed to [getting started with Cloud Endpoints](/universal-gateway/cloud-endpoints/quickstart/).
- This quickstart only barely scratches the surface of what's possible with a traffic policy—check out the [Actions overview](/traffic-policy/actions/) to see what else you can do.
- Visit the [Agent CLI command reference](/agent/cli/) for a complete list of available commands.

## Dashboard

1. In the menu on the left side, [navigate to Universal Gateway > Endpoints](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/endpoints).
1. Select the **+ New** button, then select **Cloud Endpoint** in the modal that appears.
1. Select a **[binding](/universal-gateway/bindings)**. For this example, you can choose **public**.
1. Enter the URL you want to use for your endpoint. For example, for a public Cloud Endpoint that serves traffic over HTTPS you might use `https://my-app.ngrok.dev`.
1. Select **Create Cloud Endpoint**.

After completing these steps, you'll be taken to a page where you can manage your Cloud Endpoint's [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/). Visit the URL you specified to ensure that it's online. You should see a default landing page that says "This is your new Cloud Endpoint!"

### **1** - Create your Traffic Policy

First, create a `policy.yml` on your local machine. The policy you'll create for this example will:

- Forward incoming HTTP requests to an Internal Endpoint (https://default.internal)
- If your Internal Endpoint is not reachable, it will fall back to a custom response

Paste the following into your `policy.yml` file:

```yaml title="policy.yml"
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: "forward-internal"
        config:
          url: "https://default.internal"
         on_error: continue
      - type: custom-response
        config:
          status_code: 200
          headers:
            content-type: text/html
          body: |
             <b>Agent offline!</b>
             <p>Run <code>ngrok http 80 --url https://default.internal</code> to put your application online!</p>

```

### **2** - Create your Cloud Endpoint

Now you can create your Cloud Endpoint by running the following command, replacing `{YOUR_API_KEY}` and `https://my-example-app.ngrok.dev` with your API key and desired URL:

```bash
ngrok api endpoints create \
 --api-key {YOUR_API_KEY} \
 --description "Cloud endpoint for my API" \
 --type cloud \
 --bindings public \
 --url https://my-example-app.ngrok.dev \
 --traffic-policy-file policy.yml
```

### **3** - Visit your endpoint

Your endpoint should be successfully online. Verify this by visiting the URL you assigned to it. You should see the content available at the [Internal Endpoint](/universal-gateway/internal-endpoints) you're forwarding traffic to.

If your Internal Endpoint is down, you should see the custom response you configured in your policy, which in thise case reads `Agent offline!`.
