[The ngrok JavaScript SDK](https://ngrok.github.io/ngrok-javascript/) enables you to quickly and efficiently serve Node.js applications on the internet without the need to configure low-level network primitives like IPs, certificates, load balancers, or ports.

This quickstart uses ngrok's JavaScript SDK to put a Node.js app running on your local device online and secure it so only you can access it.

## What you'll need

1. [An ngrok account](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup).
1. Your ngrok auth token, which you can find [in the dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
1. [Node.js installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your machine. You can check this by running `node -v` in your terminal.
1. A domain connected to your ngrok account. We'll refer to this as `your-reserved-domain` from here on out.
   - In the dashboard, visit [the **Domains** section](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains) and select **+ New Domain** to get started. ngrok offers free static domains, or you can [bring your own custom domain](/docs/universal-gateway/custom-domains/).

## 1. Start your app or service

Start up the app or service you'd like to put online. This is the app that your agent endpoint will forward online traffic to.

If you already have an app, you can skip this step. Otherwise, you can create a JavaScript file with the following code to set up a basic HTTP server at port `8080`.

```javascript filename="service.js"
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/html' });
    const html = `
    <html>
    <head><title>Test Page</title></head>
    <body><h1>Hello from Node.js HTTP Server!</h1></body>
    </html>
    `;
    res.end(html);
});

const port = 8080;
server.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Serving custom HTML at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

Navigate to the directory where this file is located and run the following command to start the server:

```bash
node service.js
```

## 2. Install the JavaScript SDK

Use the following terminal command to install the JavaScript SDK.

:::note
If your terminal is already running an app or service, you'll need to open a new terminal window or tab to follow this step.
:::

```bash
npm install @ngrok/ngrok
```

## 3. Create a .env file

Create a `.env` file and add [your ngrok auth token](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) to it.
This file needs to be in the same directory where you'll put the script using ngrok's JavaScript SDK.
The following terminal commands will create this directory, navigate into it, and add the `.env` file there.

```bash
mkdir ngrok-javascript-demo && cd ngrok-javascript-demo
touch .env
```

Next, add your ngrok auth token to the file like this:

```txt filename=".env"
NGROK_AUTHTOKEN=your_authtoken_here
```

Finally, you'll need to install [the `dotenv` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to access your environment variable from your code.

```bash
npm install dotenv
```

:::tip
If you don't want to use a `.env` file, you can instead [export your auth token as an environment variable](https://support.apple.com/en-il/guide/terminal/apd382cc5fa-4f58-4449-b20a-41c53c006f8f/mac) in your terminal session, or [pass the authtoken directly to the forward method](https://ngrok.github.io/ngrok-javascript/) in your code.
:::

## 4. Start your endpoint

Start your agent endpoint, which will forward public traffic to your app.

Create a new file named `example.js` in the same directory as your `.env` file and add the following code.
This example:

- Starts an Agent endpoint that forwards from your reserved domain to your service running on port `8080`.
  - If your app is running on a different port, change the example code to reflect that.
- Secures the endpoint with Google OAuth authentication.

:::note
This example uses ngrok's default Google OAuth application.
To use your own, see [the OAuth Traffic Policy Action documentation](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/oauth/#google-example).
:::

```javascript filename="example.js"
require('dotenv').config();
const ngrok = require('@ngrok/ngrok');

(async function() {
    const listener = await ngrok.forward({
        // The port your app is running on.
        addr: 8080,
        authtoken: process.env.NGROK_AUTHTOKEN,
        // If you haven't reserved a domain, omit this
        domain: "your-reserved-domain",
        oauth_provider: "google"
    });

    // Output ngrok url to console
    console.log(`Ingress established at ${listener.url()}`);
})();

// Keep the process alive
process.stdin.resume();
```

## 5. Test your endpoint

Test your endpoint by running the following terminal command:

```bash
node example.js
```

Assuming everything is set up correctly, this should print your endpoint URL to the terminal.
Your app is now live on the internet at this URL, and you can access it from any browser or tool that can make HTTP requests.

When you visit the URL, you should be prompted to log in with Google.
After logging in, you will either see your app or service, or, if you used the example app in this quickstart, you'll see "Hello from Node.js HTTP Server!" displayed in your browser.

## What's next?

- Try out [traffic policy](/docs/traffic-policy/), which enables you to [send custom headers](/traffic-policy/actions/add-headers/#examples), [terminate TLS](/traffic-policy/actions/terminate-tls/#examples), [rewrite URLs](/traffic-policy/actions/url-rewrite/#examples), and more with your endpoints.
- Learn about the [Agent SDK](/agent-sdks/) to understand how the JavaScript SDK works under the hood.
- Read [the full JavaScript SDK documentation](https://ngrok.github.io/ngrok-javascript/) for more code examples.
- Explore [Cloud Endpoints](/universal-gateway/cloud-endpoints/quickstart/), which enable you to manage traffic for multiple endpoints centrally in the cloud.
