[The ngrok Go SDK](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.ngrok.com/ngrok/v2) enables you to quickly and efficiently serve Go applications on the internet without the need to configure low-level network primitives like IPs, certificates, load balancers, or ports.

This quickstart uses ngrok's Go SDK to put a Go app running on your local device online and secure it by requiring visitors to log in with a Google account to access it.

## What you'll need

1. [An ngrok account](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup).
1. Your ngrok auth token, which you can find [in the dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
1. [Go installed](https://go.dev/doc/install) on your machine. You can check this by running `go version` in your terminal.

## 1. Reserve your domain

A new URL is generated for you every time you start an endpoint. To maintain a consistent URL, you can reserve a free static domain connected to your ngrok account.

To do so, navigate to the dashboard, visit [the **Domains** section](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains), and select **+ New Domain**. You can choose a free static domain, or you can use a custom domain you already own.

## 2. Start your app or service

Start up the app or service you'd like to put online.
This is the app that your agent endpoint will forward online traffic to.

If you don't have an app to work with, you can create a minimal a Go app using the following code to set up a basic HTTP server at port `8080`.

```go title="service.go"
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello from Go HTTP Server!")
}

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/", handler)

	fmt.Println("Starting server at http://localhost:8080")
	err := http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Server failed:", err)
	}
}
```

Navigate to the directory where this file is located and run the following command to start the server:

```bash
go run service.go
```

## 3. Install the Go SDK

Create a new Go module and use the following terminal command to install the Go SDK.

:::tip
If your terminal is already running an app or service, you'll need to open a new terminal window or tab to follow this step.
:::

```bash
mkdir ngrok-go-demo
cd ngrok-go-demo
go mod init ngrok-go-demo
go get golang.ngrok.com/ngrok/v2
```

## 4. Create a .env file

Create a `.env` file and add [your ngrok auth token](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) to it.
This file needs to be in the same directory where you initialized your Go module in the previous step.
The following terminal command will create the `.env` file.

```bash
touch .env
```

Next, add your ngrok auth token to the file like this:

```txt title=".env"
NGROK_AUTHTOKEN=your_authtoken_here
```

Finally, you'll need to install [the `godotenv` package](https://github.com/joho/godotenv?tab=readme-ov-file#godotenv--) to access your environment variable from your code.

```bash
go get github.com/joho/godotenv
```

:::tip
If you don't want to use a `.env` file, you can instead [export your auth token as an environment variable](https://support.apple.com/en-il/guide/terminal/apd382cc5fa-4f58-4449-b20a-41c53c006f8f/mac) in your terminal session, or [call `ngrok.WithAuthToken("your-token")`](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.ngrok.com/ngrok/v2#WithAuthtoken) in your code.
:::

## 5. Create your endpoint

Create your agent endpoint, which will forward public traffic to your app.

Create a new file named `example.go` in the same directory as your `.env` file and add the following code.
This example:

- Starts an Agent endpoint that forwards from your reserved domain to your service running on port `8080`.
  - If your app is running on a different port, change the example code to reflect that.
- Secures the endpoint with a Traffic Policy that requires authentication via Google OAuth.
  - Traffic policies allow you to control how traffic is handled by your endpoint, including authentication, headers, and more.

:::tip
This example uses ngrok's default Google OAuth application.
To use your own, see [the OAuth Traffic Policy Action documentation](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/oauth/#google-example).
:::

```go title="example.go"
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"os"

	"github.com/joho/godotenv"
	"golang.ngrok.com/ngrok/v2"
)

func main() {
	if err := godotenv.Load(".env"); err != nil {
		log.Fatal("Error loading .env file", err)
	}
	if err := run(context.Background()); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}

const trafficPolicy = `
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: oauth
        config:
          provider: google
`
const address = "http://localhost:8080"

func run(ctx context.Context) error {
	agent, err := ngrok.NewAgent(ngrok.WithAuthtoken(os.Getenv("NGROK_AUTHTOKEN")))
	if err != nil {
	    return err
	}

	ln, err := agent.Forward(ctx,
		ngrok.WithUpstream(address),
		ngrok.WithURL("your-reserved-domain"),
		ngrok.WithTrafficPolicy(trafficPolicy),
	)

	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error", err)
		return err
	}

	fmt.Println("Endpoint online: forwarding from", ln.URL(), "to", address)

	// Explicitly stop forwarding; otherwise it runs indefinitely
	<-ln.Done()
	return nil
}
```

## 6. Test your endpoint

Test your endpoint by running the following terminal command:

```bash
go run example.go
```

Assuming everything is set up correctly, this should print your reserved domain URL to the terminal.

When you visit the URL, you should be prompted to log in with Google.
After logging in, you see your app or service.

If you used the example app in this quickstart, you'll see **"Hello from Go HTTP Server!"** displayed in your browser.

## What's next?

- Try out [traffic policy](/docs/traffic-policy/), which enables you to [grant conditional access](https://ngrok.com/docs/traffic-policy/examples/add-authentication/#conditional-access-using-oauth-variables), [send custom headers](/traffic-policy/actions/add-headers/#examples), [rewrite URLs](/traffic-policy/actions/url-rewrite/#examples), and more with your endpoints.
- Learn about the [Agent SDK](/agent-sdks/) to understand how the JavaScript SDK works under the hood.
- Check out [the ngrok GO SDK repo](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-go?tab=readme-ov-file#ngrok-go) for more code examples.
- Explore [Cloud Endpoints](/universal-gateway/cloud-endpoints/quickstart/), which enable you to manage traffic for multiple endpoints centrally in the cloud.
