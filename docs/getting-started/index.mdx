# Quickstart

This quickstart will use the [ngrok agent](/agent/) to put your application on
the internet and secure it so that only you can access it. It assumes you already have your
own application running locally.

## Step 1: Install

<Tabs groupId="os" queryString="os">
<TabItem value="macos" label="Mac OS" default>

```bash
brew install ngrok/ngrok/ngrok
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="linux" label="Debian Linux">

```bash
curl -s https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com/ngrok.asc | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ngrok.asc >/dev/null && \
  echo "deb https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com buster main" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ngrok.list && \
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install ngrok
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

```bash
choco install ngrok
```

Run this in an Administrator Command Prompt.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Or [download the ngrok agent from our Download
page](https://ngrok.com/download) if you can't use one of the options above.

The ngrok agent is a zero-dependency CLI program that runs on all major
operating systems. Test that you installed it correctly by running the
following command in your terminal and confirm that ngrok prints its help text.

```bash
ngrok help
```

## Step 2: Connect your account

Next, connect your ngrok agent to your ngrok account. If you haven't already,
[sign up for an ngrok account](https://dashboard.ngrok.com). Copy your [ngrok
authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) from your
ngrok dashboard.

Run the following command in your terminal to install the authtoken and connect
the ngrok agent to your account.

```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken <TOKEN>
```

## Step 3: Put your app online

Start ngrok by running the following command.

```bash
ngrok http http://localhost:8080
```

We're assuming that you have a working web application listening on
http://localhost:8080. If your app is listening on a different URL, change the
above command to match.

You will see something similar to the following console UI in your terminal.

```bash
ngrok                                                                   (Ctrl+C to quit)

Session Status                online
Account                       inconshreveable (Plan: Free)
Version                       3.0.0
Region                        United States (us)
Latency                       78ms
Web Interface                 http://127.0.0.1:4040
Forwarding                    https://84c5df474.ngrok-free.dev -> http://localhost:8080

Connections                   ttl     opn     rt1     rt5     p50     p90
                              0       0       0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00
```

Open the Forwarding URL in your browser and you will see your web application.

- This URL is available to anyone on the internet. Test it out by sending it to
  a friend!
- Your app is available over HTTPS (notice the ðŸ”’ in your browser window) with
  a valid certificate that ngrok automatically manages for you.

## Step 4: Always use the same domain

If you want to keep the same URL each time you use ngrok, [create a static
domain on your dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/cloud-edge/domains) and
then use the `--domain` flag to ask the ngrok agent to use it. First, stop
ngrok with `Ctrl+C` and then run ngrok again:

```
ngrok http 8080 --domain jumpy-red-mollusk.ngrok-free.app
```

## Step 5: Secure your app

You may not want everyone to be able to access your application. ngrok can
quickly add authentication to your app without any changes. If your Google
account is `alan@example.com`, you can restrict access only for yourself by
running ngrok with:

```
ngrok http http://localhost:8080 --oauth=google --oauth-allow-email=alan@example.com
```

Anyone accessing your app will be prompted to log in with Google and only your
account will be allowed to access it. Keep in mind that when you restart ngrok,
if you don't specify the `--domain` flag that your app's URL changed, so make
sure to visit the new one.

If you don't have a Google account or you want a simpler form of auth, you can
protect your app with a username and password like so:

```
ngrok http http://localhost:8080 --basic-auth 'username:a-very-secure-password'
```

<img width="450" height="450" src="/docs/img/docs/ngrok-basic-auth.png" />

ngrok supports many forms of authentication including:

- [OAuth](/http/oauth/) (what we just used)
- [Basic Auth](/http/basic-auth/) (what we just used)
- [IP Restrictions](/http/ip-restrictions/)
- [Webhook Verification](/http/webhook-verification/)
- [Mutual TLS](/http/mutual-tls/)
- [OpenID Connect](/http/openid-connect/)
- [SAML](/http/saml/)

## What's next?

- Browse examples in the [HTTP documentation](/http/?cty=agent-cli) of other ways ngrok can augment your application
- Bring your own [custom domain to ngrok](/http/#bring-your-own-domain)
- Create connectivity to non-HTTP services such as SSH, RDP, or game servers using [TCP Endpoints](/tcp/)
- Embed ngrok in your app programmatically without the agent with our [Agent SDKs](/agent-sdks/)
- Add your [API key and automate via the `ngrok api` command](/api/#quickstart)
