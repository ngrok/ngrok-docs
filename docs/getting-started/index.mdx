ngrok's core functionality is built around [Agent Endpoints](/universal-gateway/agent-endpoints/): ephemeral tunnels for connecting your app, regardless of where it's running, to the ngrok platform.
One of the most common use cases is to put an app running on your local device onlineâ€”for example, to share a work in progress on the public internet without hosting and publishing it.

The simplest way to accomplish this is to install the [ngrok Agent CLI](/agent/) and use it to create an agent endpoint that forwards traffic to your localhost.
This quickstart shows you how to use the CLI for this purpose, as well as how to implement basic security measures by requiring visitors to log in with a Google account to access your app.

## What you'll need

1. [An ngrok account](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup).
1. Your ngrok auth token, which you can find [in the dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).

## 1. Install the ngrok Agent CLI

<Tabs groupId="os" queryString="os">
<TabItem value="macos" label="Mac OS" default>

```bash
brew install ngrok
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="linux" label="Debian Linux">

```bash
curl -sSL https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com/ngrok.asc \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ngrok.asc >/dev/null \
  && echo "deb https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com buster main" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ngrok.list \
  && sudo apt update \
  && sudo apt install ngrok
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

```bash
choco install ngrok
```

Run this in an administrator command prompt.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Or [download the ngrok Agent](https://download.ngrok.com) if you can't use one of the options above.

You can also visit the [setup and installation page in the dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup) for directions and commands specific to your platform.

To test that it's been installed correctly, run the following command in your terminal and confirm that ngrok prints its help text.

```bash
ngrok help
```

## 2. Connect your account

Connect your ngrok agent to your ngrok account.
Copy your [ngrok auth token](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) from your ngrok dashboard.

Run the following command in your terminal to install the auth token and connect the ngrok agent to your account.

```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken <TOKEN>
```

You can also visit the [setup and installation page in the dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup) for the configuration command specific to your account.

## 3. Start your app or service

## 4. Put your app online

Start ngrok by running the following command.

```bash
ngrok http http://localhost:8080
```

We're assuming that you have a working web application listening on
http://localhost:8080.
If your app is listening on a different URL, change the above command to match.

You will see something similar to the following console UI in your terminal.

```bash
ngrok                                                                   (Ctrl+C to quit)

Session Status                online
Account                       inconshreveable (Plan: Free)
Version                       3.0.0
Region                        United States (us)
Latency                       78ms
Web Interface                 http://127.0.0.1:4040
Forwarding                    https://84c5df474.ngrok-free.dev -> http://localhost:8080

Connections                   ttl     opn     rt1     rt5     p50     p90
                              0       0       0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00
```

Open the forwarding URL in your browser and you will see your web application.

- This URL is available to anyone on the internet. Test it out by sending it to a friend!
- Your app is available over HTTPS (notice the ðŸ”’ in your browser window) with a valid certificate that ngrok automatically manages for you.

## 4. Always use the same domain

If you want to keep the same URL each time you use ngrok, [create a static domain on your dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains) and then use the `--url` flag to ask the ngrok agent to use it.
First, stop ngrok with `Ctrl+C` and then run ngrok again:

```
ngrok http 8080 --url https://jumpy-red-mollusk.ngrok-free.app
```

## 5. Secure your app

You may not want everyone to be able to access your application.
ngrok can quickly add authentication to your app without any changes.

In general, [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/) is the recommended way to secure your app.

<SecureYourApp firstTabValue="google-oauth" firstTabLabel="Google OAuth" secondTabLabel="Basic Auth" secondTabValue="basic-auth">

The following example demonstrates how to use [the `basic-auth` traffic policy action](/traffic-policy/actions/basic-auth/) to only allow visitors with the credentials `user:password1` or `admin:password2` to access your app.

<ConfigExample
	snippetText={null}
	showLineNumbers={true}
	jsonMetastring="{5-51}"
	yamlMetastring="{4-28}"
	config={{
		on_http_request: [
			{
				actions: [
					{
						type: "basic-auth",
						config: {
							realm: "sample-realm",
							credentials: ["user:password1", "admin:password2"],
							enforce: true,
						},
					}
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>

You can test your traffic policy by sending the following request to your app:

```bash
$ curl --request GET \
  --url http://example-api.ngrok.app/ \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic dXNlcjpwYXNzd29yZDE=`'
```

:::tip
This example uses `dXNlcjpwYXNzd29yZDE=`, which is a [base64 encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) version of `user:password1`.
:::

You should get the following response:

```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
content-type: text/html
Successfully Authenticated!
...
```

If you send the same request without the `Authorization` header, you should receive a `401 Unauthorized` response.

## Running ngrok persistently

While this guide gets you started with ngrok, you might want your tunnel to keep running even after you close your terminal window.
Here are a few options to achieve this:

- Using Docker: Docker allows you to containerize ngrok for easy deployment and management. See the documentation for [Docker configuration](/using-ngrok-with/docker/).

- Systemd service (Linux): For systemd-based systems, you can create a systemd service to automatically start and manage ngrok. Refer to the documentation for [Systemd service creation](/agent/#background-service).
- Windows service (Windows): For Windows systems, you can create a Windows service to automatically start and manage ngrok. Refer to the documentation for [Background Service](/agent/#background-service).
- Detaching a Tmux session (optional): If you're familiar with Tmux, you can detach your ngrok session from your terminal window. (Note: This is an advanced option). Refer to a guide on using [Tmux](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-tmux-on-a-cloud-server) for more information:

## What's next?

- Browse examples in the [HTTP documentation](/universal-gateway/http/?cty=agent-cli) of other ways ngrok can augment your application
- Bring your own [custom domain to ngrok](/universal-gateway/http/#bring-your-own-domain)
- Create connectivity to non-HTTP services such as SSH, RDP, or game servers using [TCP Endpoints](/universal-gateway/tcp/)
- Embed ngrok in your app programmatically without the agent with our [Agent SDKs](/agent-sdks/)
- Add your [API key and automate via the `ngrok api` command](/api/#quickstart)
