ngrok's core functionality is built around [Agent Endpoints](/universal-gateway/agent-endpoints/): ephemeral tunnels for connecting your app, regardless of where it's running, to the ngrok platform.
One of the most common use cases is to put an app running on your local device online—for example, to share a work in progress on the public internet without hosting and publishing it.

The simplest way to accomplish this is to install the [ngrok Agent CLI](/agent/) and use it to create an agent endpoint that forwards traffic to your localhost.
This quickstart walks you through this process, as well as how to implement basic security measures by requiring visitors to log in with a Google account to access your app.

## What you'll need

1. [An ngrok account](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup).
1. Your ngrok auth token, which you can find [in the dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).

## 1. Reserve your domain

A new URL is generated for you every time you start an agent endpoint. 
To maintain a consistent URL, you can reserve a free static domain connected to your ngrok account.

To do so, navigate to the dashboard, visit [the **Domains** section](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains), and select **+ New Domain**. 
You can choose a free static domain, or you can use a custom domain you already own.
We'll come back to this in a later step.

## 2. Install the ngrok Agent CLI

<Tabs groupId="os" queryString="os">
<TabItem value="macos" label="Mac OS" default>

```bash
brew install ngrok
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="linux" label="Debian Linux">

```bash
curl -sSL https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com/ngrok.asc \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ngrok.asc >/dev/null \
  && echo "deb https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com buster main" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ngrok.list \
  && sudo apt update \
  && sudo apt install ngrok
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

```bash
choco install ngrok
```

Run this in an administrator command prompt.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Or [download the ngrok agent directly](https://download.ngrok.com) if you can't use one of the options above.

To test that it's been installed correctly, run the following command in your terminal and confirm that ngrok prints its help text.

```bash
ngrok help
```

## 3. Connect your account

Connect your agent to your ngrok account by providing your auth token as shown below—replace `$YOUR_TOKEN` with the token provided to you [in the dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).

```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken $YOUR_TOKEN
```

## 4. Start your app or service

Start up the app or service you'd like to put online.
This is the app that your agent endpoint will forward online traffic to.

If you don't have an app to work with, you can create a minimal Node.js app using the following code to set up a basic HTTP server at port `8080`.

```javascript title="service.js"
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/html' });
    const html = `
    <html>
    <head><title>Test Page</title></head>
    <body><h1>Hello from Node.js HTTP Server!</h1></body>
    </html>
    `;
    res.end(html);
});

const port = 8080;
server.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Serving custom HTML at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

Navigate to the directory where this file is located and run the following command to start the server:

```bash
node service.js
```

## 5. Put your app online

Start ngrok by running the following command—replace `$PORT` with the specific port where your app is running, such as `8080` or `3000`.
The optional `--url` flag connects your app to your reserved domain (replace `$YOUR_DOMAIN` with this) from step 1 so it will always appear at this URL when you start up a new agent.

```bash
ngrok http $PORT --url $YOUR_DOMAIN
```

The agent should print a console UI to your terminal to confirm that it's online and forwarding as intended.
Open the forwarding URL in your browser to see your web application, which is now available over HTTPS with a valid certificate that ngrok automatically manages for you.

## 6. Secure your app

ngrok makes it simple to add authentication to your app with minimal configuration.
