# Quickstart: ngrok-rust

---

This quickstart will use the [ngrok-rust Agent SDK](/agent-sdks/) to put a Rust
app on the internet and secure it so that only you can access it.

## What is ngrok-rust?

ngrok-rust is an [open-source, idiomatic Rust
crate](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-rust) for embedding secure ingress
directly into your Rust applications. If you’ve used the ngrok agent before,
you can think of ngrok-rust as the agent packaged as a Rust crate.

ngrok-rust enables you to serve Rust services on the internet in a single line
of code without setting up low-level network primitives like IPs, certificates,
load balancers, and ports. Applications using ngrok-rust listen on ngrok’s
global ingress network and your app gets incoming streams with tokio’s
`AsyncRead` and `AsyncWrite` traits — compatible with
`axum::Server::builder()` and `hyper::Server::builder()`. This makes it
incredibly easy to drop ngrok-rust into any application that uses the popular
axum or hyper crates.

You may want to open the [ngrok-rust package documentation on
docs.rs](https://docs.rs/ngrok/latest/ngrok/) as you work through this guide.

## Step 1: Install ngrok-rust

First, create a new Rust app and install the `ngrok`, `axum` and `tokio`
crates. This guide assumes you [already have Rust
installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

```bash
mkdir ngrok-rust-quickstart
cd ngrok-rust-quickstart
cargo init
cargo add ngrok -F axum
cargo add axum
cargo add tokio -F rt-multi-thread -F macros
```

## Step 2: Create your app

In the `ngrok-rust-quickstart` directory, create the following `main.rs` file:

```rust showLineNumbers
use axum::{routing::get, Router};
use ngrok::prelude::*;
use std::error::Error;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    // build our application with a route
    let app = Router::new().route("/", get(|| async { "Hello from ngrok-rust!" }));

    // listen on ngrok ingress (i.e. https://myapp.ngrok.dev)
    let listener = ngrok::Session::builder()
        .authtoken_from_env()
        .connect()
        .await?
        .http_endpoint()
        .listen()
        .await?;
    println!("App URL: {:?}", listener.url());
    axum::Server::builder(listener)
        .serve(app.into_make_service())
        .await?;
    Ok(())
}
```

:::note In this code

- **Lines 11-17**: connect to ngrok and listen for HTTP traffic on a randomly-assigned endpoint URL
- **Line 18**: print your app's endpoint url
- **Line 19-21**: start an axum web server handling connections from the ngrok listener

:::

## Step 3: Run it!

Copy [the ngrok authtoken on your
dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken). You may
need to [sign up for ngrok](https://ngrok.com) if you haven't already.

Run your application with your authtoken in the environment:

```bash
NGROK_AUTHTOKEN="<TOKEN>" cargo r
```

Your terminal will print out your app's URL. Visit the URL in a browser and
confirm you see "Hello from ngrok-rust!". Your Rust application is now live on
the internet, with a URL that anyone on the internet can access. Test it out by
sending it to a friend!

## Step 4: Always use the same domain

If you want to keep the same URL each time you run your app, [create a static
domain on your dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/cloud-edge/domains) and
then update your `Session::builder` chain to use it. Stop your app with
`Ctrl+C`, update your code and then rerun it:

```rust showLineNumbers
    let listener = ngrok::Session::builder()
        .authtoken_from_env()
        .connect()
        .await?
        .http_endpoint()
        .domain("jumpy-red-mollusk.ngrok-free.app")
        .listen()
        .await?;
```

## Step 5: Secure your app

You may not want everyone to be able to access your application. ngrok can
quickly add authentication to your app with a few lines of code.

If your Google account is `alan@example.com`, you can restrict access only for
yourself by modifying your `main.rs` file to:

```rust showLineNumbers
use axum::{routing::get, Router};
use ngrok::prelude::*;
use ngrok::config::*;
use std::error::Error;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    // build our application with a route
    let app = Router::new().route("/", get(|| async { "Hello World!" }));

    // listen on ngrok ingress (i.e. https://my-rust-app.ngrok.dev)
    let listener = ngrok::Session::builder()
        .authtoken_from_env()
        .connect()
        .await?
        .http_endpoint()
        // highlight-start
        .oauth(OauthOptions::new("google").allow_email("alan@example.com"))
        // highlight-end
        .listen()
        .await?;
    println!("App URL: {:?}", listener.url());
    axum::Server::builder(listener)
        .serve(app.into_make_service())
        .await?;
    Ok(())
}
```

:::note In this code

- **Line 17**: Require visitors to authenticate with Google before they access your application. You can [choose other providers](/http/oauth/#supported-providers). Only allow `alan@example.com` access to the application

:::

Run your app again and visit the URL it prints in the terminal.

Anyone accessing your app will be prompted to log in with Google and only your
account will be allowed to access it. Keep in mind that when you restarted
ngrok, your app's URL changed, so make sure to visit the new one.

## Next Steps

- Read the [ngrok-rust package documentation on
  docs.rs](https://docs.rs/ngrok/latest/ngrok/)
- Star the [ngrok-rust GitHub repo](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-rust) and follow
  it for updates.
- Browse [Rust examples of HTTP Endpoints](/http/?cty=rust-sdk) of other ways ngrok can augment your application.
- Bring your own [custom domain to ngrok](/http/#bring-your-own-domain)
- Create connectivity for non-HTTP protocols such as SSH, RDP, or game servers using [TCP Endpoints](/tcp/?cty=rust-sdk)
