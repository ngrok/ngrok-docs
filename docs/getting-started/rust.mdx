[The ngrok Rust SDK](https://docs.rs/ngrok/latest/ngrok/) enables you to quickly and efficiently serve Rust applications on the internet without the need to configure low-level network primitives like IPs, certificates, load balancers, or ports.

This quickstart uses ngrok's Rust SDK to put a Rust app running on your local device online and secure it by requiring visitors to log in with a Google account to access it.

## What you'll need

1. [An ngrok account](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup).
1. Your ngrok auth token, which you can find [in the dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
1. [Rust installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) on your machine. You can check this by running `rustc --version` in your terminal.

## 1. Reserve your domain

A new URL is generated for you every time you start an endpoint. To maintain a consistent URL, you can reserve a free static domain connected to your ngrok account.

To do so, navigate to the dashboard, visit [the **Domains** section](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains), and select **+ New Domain**. You can choose a free static domain, or you can use a custom domain you already own.

## 2. Start your app or service

Start up the app or service you'd like to put online.
This is the app that your agent endpoint will forward online traffic to.

If you don't have an app to work with, you can set up a basic HTTP server at port `8080`.

First, create a directory for your Rust project and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir ngrok-rust-server
cd ngrok-rust-server
```

Next, create a new Rust project:

```bash
cargo init
```

Then, replace the contents of `src/main.rs` with the following code to set up a basic HTTP server:

```rust title="ngrok-rust-server/src/main.rs"
use std::io::{Read, Write};
use std::net::{TcpListener, TcpStream};

fn handle_connection(mut stream: TcpStream) {
    let mut buffer = [0; 512];

    // Read from the stream
    if let Ok(_) = stream.read(&mut buffer) {
        let body = "Hello from Rust HTTP Server!";
        let response = format!(
            "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\
             Content-Length: {}\r\n\
             Content-Type: text/plain\r\n\
             Connection: close\r\n\r\n\
             {}",
            body.len(),
            body
        );

        if let Err(e) = stream.write_all(response.as_bytes()) {
            eprintln!("Write error: {}", e);
        }

        // Flush to make sure the response is sent
        if let Err(e) = stream.flush() {
            eprintln!("Flush error: {}", e);
        }
    }
}

fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:8080")?;
    println!("Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8080");

    for stream in listener.incoming() {
        match stream {
            Ok(stream) => handle_connection(stream),
            Err(e) => eprintln!("Connection failed: {}", e),
        }
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

To run the server, navigate to the root directory of the project (where the `Cargo.toml` file is located) and run the following command:

```bash
cargo run
```

## 3. Install the Rust SDK

Create a new Rust project and use the following terminal commands to install the Rust SDK.

:::tip
If your terminal is already running an app or service, you'll need to open a new terminal window or tab to follow this step.
:::

```bash
mkdir ngrok-rust-demo
cd ngrok-rust-demo
cargo init
cargo add ngrok
```

Then, edit your `Cargo.toml` file to include the necessary dependencies:

```toml title="ngrok-rust-demo/Cargo.toml"
[package]
name = "ngrok-rust-demo"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
ngrok = {version = "0.14.0"}
tokio = { version = "1", features = [
    "full"
] }
axum = { version = "0.7.4", features = ["tokio"] }
async-trait = "0.1.59"
hyper = {version = "1", features = ["full"]}
hyper-util = { version = "0.1", features = [
	"full"
] }
url = "2.5.4"
```

## 5. Create your endpoint

Create your agent endpoint, which will forward public traffic to your app.

In the `ngrok-rust-demo` directory you created in the previous step, add the following code to your `src/main.rs` file.

This example:

- Starts an Agent endpoint that forwards from your reserved domain to your service running on port `8080`.
  - If your app is running on a different port, change the example code to reflect that.
- Secures the endpoint with a Traffic Policy that requires authentication via Google OAuth.
  - Traffic policies allow you to control how traffic is handled by your endpoint, including authentication, headers, and more.

:::tip
This example uses ngrok's default Google OAuth application.
To use your own, see [the OAuth Traffic Policy Action documentation](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/oauth/#google-example).
:::

```rust title="ngrok-rust-demo/src/main.rs"
#![deny(warnings)]
use ngrok::config::ForwarderBuilder;
use url::Url;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error + Send + Sync>> {
    // Set up ngrok tunnel
    let session = ngrok::Session::builder()
        .authtoken_from_env()
        .connect()
        .await?;

    let domain = "your-reserved-domain";

    // Forward HTTP traffic from ngrok to the local server
    let _listener = session
        .http_endpoint()
        .domain(domain)
        .traffic_policy(r#"{"on_http_request": [{"actions": [{"type": "oauth","config": {"provider": "google"}}]}]}"#)
        .listen_and_forward(Url::parse("http://localhost:8080").unwrap())
        .await?;

    println!("Ngrok tunnel established at {}", domain);

    // Wait indefinitely
    tokio::signal::ctrl_c().await?;
    Ok(())
}
```

## 6. Test your endpoint

Test your endpoint by running the following terminal command, swapping in [your authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).

```bash
NGROK_AUTHTOKEN=YOUR_AUTHTOKEN_HERE cargo run
```

Assuming everything is set up correctly, this should print your reserved domain URL to the terminal.

When you visit the URL, you should be prompted to log in with Google.
After logging in, you see your app or service.

If you used the example app in this quickstart, you'll see **"Hello from Rust HTTP Server!"** displayed in your browser.

## What's next?

- Try out [traffic policy](/docs/traffic-policy/), which enables you to [grant conditional access](https://ngrok.com/docs/traffic-policy/examples/add-authentication/#conditional-access-using-oauth-variables), [send custom headers](/traffic-policy/actions/add-headers/#examples), [rewrite URLs](/traffic-policy/actions/url-rewrite/#examples), and more with your endpoints.
- Learn about the [Agent SDK](/agent-sdks/) to understand how the Rust SDK works under the hood.
- Check out [the ngrok Rust SDK repo](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-rust/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#ngrok-rust) for more code examples.
- Explore [Cloud Endpoints](/universal-gateway/cloud-endpoints/quickstart/), which enable you to manage traffic for multiple endpoints centrally in the cloud.
