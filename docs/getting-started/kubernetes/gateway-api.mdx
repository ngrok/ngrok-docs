This quickstart uses the [ngrok Kubernetes Operator](/docs/k8s) and [Gateway API resources](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) to make the services you've deployed to Kubernetes available on the public internet.

Use this method if you:

- Want precise, Kubernetes-native control over routing behavior.
- Are building on a multi-team platform where the separation of concerns between the [roles and personas](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/concepts/roles-and-personas/) (infrastructure provider, cluster operator, application developer) matters.
- Want to align with the Kubernetes community's vision for the future of ingress.

:::note
The ngrok Kubernetes Operator is available to all ngrok users at no additional charge.
You only incur costs if the resources provisioned by the controller incur a cost.
Find more details on our [pricing page](https://ngrok.com/pricing), or, if you're a free user, the [free plan limits](/docs/pricing-limits/free-plan-limits/).

## What you'll need

<K8sPrereq />

## 1. Install the ngrok Kubernetes Operator

<K8sSetup />
<K8sGWAPI />
<K8sInstall />

## 2. Get your domain

<Domain />

## 3. Deploy a sample service

<K8sSample />

## 4. Define your `Gateway` and `HTTPSRoute` resources

This manifest exposes the `tinyllama` sample service on `$YOUR_DOMAIN`.
If you already have a different deployment on your cluster, you'll need to change the `backendRefs` name and port.

```yaml title="gwapi.yaml"
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: ngrok-gateway
  namespace: default
spec:
  gatewayClassName: ngrok
  listeners:
    - name: http
      protocol: HTTP
      port: 80
      hostname: "$NGROK_DOMAIN"
      allowedRoutes:
        namespaces:
          from: All
---
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: tinyllama-route
  namespace: default
spec:
  parentRefs:
		- group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
			kind: Gateway
			name: ngrok-gateway
			namespace: default
  hostnames:
		- "$NGROK_DOMAIN"
  rules:
		- matches:
			- path:
					type: PathPrefix
					value: /
			backendRefs:
				- name: tinyllama
					port: 80
```

Apply the manifest with `kubectl apply -f gwapi.yaml`.

The ngrok Kubernetes Operator watches your cluster for `Gateway` and `HTTPRoute` resources that reference the `ngrok` GatewayClass, and immediately provisions a new agent endpoint.

You can now send a request to `$NGROK_DOMAIN` with your browser or `curl`.
Your Kubernetes service is now available to anyone on the public internet.

## 4. Secure your app with Traffic Policy

In cases where you need to restrict access to your API or app, [Traffic Policy](/docs/traffic-policy) and the [`restrict-ips`](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/restrict-ips) let you quickly allow only certain addresses to access your endpoint.

First, copy your public IP address via our [`ip4v.ngrok.com` mini-app](https://ipv4.ngrok.com/).

To add the rule, create a new `NgrokTrafficPolicy` resource and add it to your `Gateway` resource as an annotation.
This way, the rule runs on all requests matching any of the hostnames from the listeners on your `Gateway`.
Be sure to replace `$YOUR_PUBLIC_IP` with the value you just copied.

```yaml title="gwapi.yaml"
apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
kind: NgrokTrafficPolicy
metadata:
  name: restrict-ips
  namespace: default
spec:
  policy:
    on_http_request:
      - actions:
          - type: restrict-ips
            config:
              enforce: true
              allow:
                - $YOUR_PUBLIC_IP
---
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: ngrok-gateway
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    k8s.ngrok.com/traffic-policy: restrict-ips
spec:
  gatewayClassName: ngrok
  listeners:
    - name: http
      protocol: HTTP
      port: 80
      hostname: "$NGROK_DOMAIN"
      allowedRoutes:
        namespaces:
          from: Same
---
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: tinyllama-route
  namespace: default
spec:
  parentRefs:
		- group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
			kind: Gateway
			name: ngrok-gateway
			namespace: default
  hostnames:
		- "$NGROK_DOMAIN"
  rules:
		- matches:
			- path:
					type: PathPrefix
					value: /
			backendRefs:
				- name: tinyllama
					port: 80
```

Re-apply the manifest with `kubectl apply -f gwapi.yaml`.

You can also add Traffic Policy as an [`ExtensionRef` filter](/docs/k8s/guides/using-gwapi/#use-ngroktrafficpolicy-on-httproutes) if you want to run certain rules only on a single route.

## 5. Start sending requests

Learn more about using ngrok with your Kubernetes deployments:

- Read the [guide to using Gateway API](/docs/k8s/guides/using-gwapi) with ngrok
- [Route requests to many upstream services](/docs/k8s/guides/how-to/request-routing/) based on the path, headers, and query parameters
- Explore [TLS](/docs/k8s/guides/how-to/tls-routing/) or [TCP](/docs/k8s/guides/how-to/tcp-routing/) routing with Gateway API
- Deploy an [API gateway](/docs/guides/api-gateway/kubernetes/) in one or [multiple clouds](/docs/guides/api-gateway/multicloud/)
