This quickstart uses the [ngrok Kubernetes Operator](/docs/k8s) and a [Kubernetes Ingress object](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) to make the services you've deployed to Kubernetes available on the public internet.

Use this method if you:

- Want a drop-in, familiar ingress experience for your K8s apps.
- Already using `Ingress` resources across your clusters and don't want to adopt new APIs.
- You're looking for basic L7 routing and don't need the sophistication of [Gateway API](/docs/getting-started/kubernetes/gateway-api) or customization of [custom resources](/docs/getting-started/kubernetes/crds).

:::note
The ngrok Kubernetes Operator is available to all ngrok users at no additional charge.
You only incur costs if the resources provisioned by the controller incur a cost.
Find more details on our [pricing page](https://ngrok.com/pricing), or, if you're a free user, the [free plan limits](/docs/pricing-limits/free-plan-limits/).

## What you'll need

<K8sPrereq />

## 1. Install the ngrok Kubernetes Operator

<K8sSetup />
<K8sInstall />

## 2. Get your domain

<Domain />

## 3. Deploy a sample service

<K8sSample />

## 4. Create your Ingress manifest

This manifest exposes the `tinyllama` sample service on `$YOUR_DOMAIN`.
If you already have a different deployment on your cluster, you'll need to change the backend service name and port.

```yaml title="ingress.yaml"
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: tinyllama
  namespace: default
spec:
  ingressClassName: ngrok
  rules:
    - host: "$YOUR_DOMAIN"
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: tinyllama
                port:
                  number: 80
```

Apply the manifest with `kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml`.

The ngrok Kubernetes Operator watches your cluster for `Ingress` resources with the `ngrok` ingress class, and immediately provisions a new agent endpoint based on this manifest.

You can now send a request to `$NGROK_DOMAIN` with your browser or `curl`.
Your Kubernetes service is now available to anyone on the public internet.

## 4. Secure your app with Traffic Policy

In cases where you need to restrict access to your API or app, [Traffic Policy](/docs/traffic-policy) and the [`restrict-ips`](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/restrict-ips) let you quickly allow only certain addresses to access your endpoint.

First, copy your public IP address via our [`ip4v.ngrok.com` mini-app](https://ipv4.ngrok.com/).

To add the rule, create a new `NgrokTrafficPolicy` resource and add it to your Ingress as an annotation.
Replace `$YOUR_PUBLIC_IP` with the value you just copied.

```yaml title="ingress.yaml"
apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
kind: NgrokTrafficPolicy
metadata:
  name: restrict-ips
  namespace: default
spec:
  policy:
    on_http_request:
      - actions:
          - type: restrict-ips
            config:
              enforce: true
              allow:
                - $YOUR_PUBLIC_IP
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: hello-world
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    k8s.ngrok.com/traffic-policy: restrict-ips
spec:
  ingressClassName: ngrok
  rules:
    - host: "$YOUR_DOMAIN"
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: tinyllmama
                port:
                  number: 80
```

Re-apply the manifest with `kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml`.

You can also choose to add it as the backend for a specific rule or the default backend.
See our [Ingresses doc](/docs/k8s/guides/using-ingresses/#using-ngroktrafficpolicy-with-ingress) for details and why you would choose option over another.

## 5. Start sending requests

<Request />

Learn more about using ngrok with your Kubernetes deployments:

- Read the [guide to using Ingress](/docs/k8s/guides/using-ingresses) with ngrok
- [Route requests to many upstream services](/docs/k8s/guides/how-to/request-routing/) based on the path, headers, and query parameters
- Deploy an [API gateway](/docs/guides/api-gateway/kubernetes/) in one or [multiple clouds](/docs/guides/api-gateway/multicloud/)

For more ways to filter and manage traffic:

- All our [available actions](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/)

Finally, explore the [Traffic Inspector in your dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/traffic-inspector) for real-time observability of traffic flowing through your endpoint.
