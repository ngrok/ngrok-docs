This quickstart uses the [ngrok Kubernetes Operator](/docs/k8s) and a
[ngrok's custom resourecs](/docs/k8s/crds) (CRs) to make the services you've deployed
to Kubernetes available on the public internet.

Benefits:

- ngrok's CRs are easier to configure and require less YAML than either [Ingress](/docs/getting-started/kubernetes/ingress) or [Gateway API](/docs/getting-started/kubernetes/gateway-api) resources.
- TK

Example use cases:

- TK
- TK

## What you'll need

- An ngrok account and a [reserved domain](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains)
- A running K8s cluster with `kubectl` access with at least one service
- [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/) and [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) 3.0.0 or later installed locally

## 1. Install the ngrok Kubernetes Operator

<K8sSetup />
<K8sInstall />

## 2. Create or edit your Ingress manifest

TK

The ngrok Kubernetes operator watches for these and provisions ngrok endpoints

## 3. Secure your app with Traffic Policy

TK
