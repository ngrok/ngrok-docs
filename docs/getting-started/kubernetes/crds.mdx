This quickstart uses the [ngrok Kubernetes Operator](/docs/k8s) and [ngrok's custom resources](/docs/k8s/crds) (CRs) to make the services you've deployed to Kubernetes available on the public internet.

Use this method if you:

- Want the easiest path, requiring the least amount of YAML, to create ingress for your resources compared to [Ingress](/docs/getting-started/kubernetes/ingress) or [Gateway API](/docs/getting-started/kubernetes/gateway-api) resources.
- Are okay with using Kubernetes-native resources, but not necessarily following Kubernetes standards.

:::note
The ngrok Kubernetes Operator is available to all ngrok users at no additional charge.
You only incur costs if the resources provisioned by the controller incur a cost
Find more details on our [pricing page](https://ngrok.com/pricing), or, if you're a free user, the [free plan limits](/docs/pricing-limits/free-plan-limits/).

## What you'll need

<K8sPrereq />

## 1. Install the ngrok Kubernetes Operator

<K8sSetup />
<K8sInstall />

## 2. Get your domain

<Domain />

## 3. Deploy a sample service

<K8sSample />

## 4. Create your endpoint manifest

You have two options to expose your Kubernetes service with ngrok's CRDs. The primary two types are `CloudEndpoint` and `AgentEndpoint`.

1. A single `AgentEndpoint` resource: This option is simplest, but is typically limited to exposing one service on a hostname.
2. A pair of `CloudEndpoint` and `AgentEndpoint` resources: This option allows you to route traffic to any number of Kubernetes services from a single hostname depending on their path, headers, and more using [expressions](/docs/traffic-policy/concepts/expressions/) and the [`forward-internal` Traffic Policy action](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/forward-internal).

When using other types of configuration with the operator such as `Ingress` and Gateway API resources, the operator translates all of them into
`CloudEndpoint` and `AgentEndpoint` resources. Using the `CloudEndpoint`/`AgentEndpoint` resources directly gives you maximum control over your ngrok operator configuration.
For more information about cloud and agent endpoints, see [the endpoint types page](/docs/universal-gateway/types/).

This manifest exposes a Kubernetes service named `tinyllama` listening on port `80` on `$YOUR_DOMAIN`.
If you already have a different deployment on your cluster, you'll need to change the backend service name and port.

<Tabs groupId="crds" queryString="crd-option">
  <TabItem value="agent-endpoint" label="AgentEndpoint" default>

```yaml title="ngrok-crds.yaml"
apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
kind: AgentEndpoint
metadata:
  name: tinyllama-endpoint
spec:
  url: https://$YOUR_DOMAIN
  upstream:
    url: http://tinyllama.default:80
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cloud-agent-endpoint" label="CloudEndpoint + AgentEndpoint">

```yaml title="ngrok-crds.yaml"
apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
kind: CloudEndpoint
metadata:
  name: tinyllama-cloud-endpoint
spec:
  url: $YOUR_DOMAIN
trafficPolicy:
  policy:
    on_http_request:
      - actions:
        - type: forward-internal
          config:
            url: http://tinyllama.internal
---
apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
kind: AgentEndpoint
metadata:
  name: tinyllama-endpoint
spec:
  url: http://tinyllama.internal
  upstream:
    url: http://tinyllama.default:80
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Apply the manifest with `kubectl -n ngrok-operator apply -f ngrok-crds.yaml`.

The ngrok Kubernetes Operator watches your cluster for `AgentEndpoint` and `CloudEndpoint` resources you create, and provisions a new agent endpoint to forward traffic into your Service.

You can now send a request to `$NGROK_DOMAIN` with your browser or `curl`.
Your Kubernetes service is now available to anyone on the public internet.

## 4. Secure your app with Traffic Policy

In cases where you need to restrict access to your API or app, [Traffic Policy](/docs/traffic-policy) and the [`restrict-ips`](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/restrict-ips) let you quickly allow only certain addresses to access your endpoint.

First, copy your public IP address via our [`ip4v.ngrok.com` mini-app](https://ipv4.ngrok.com/).

<Tabs groupId="crds" queryString="crd-option">
  <TabItem value="agent-endpoint" label="AgentEndpoint" default>

Add a `trafficPolicy.inline` field followed by the Traffic Policy rule itself.

```yaml title="ngrok-crds.yaml"
apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
kind: AgentEndpoint
metadata:
  name: tinyllama-endpoint
spec:
  url: https://$YOUR_DOMAIN
  upstream:
    url: http://tinyllama.default:80
  trafficPolicy:
    inline:
      on_http_request:
        - actions:
            - type: restrict-ips
              config:
                enforce: true
                allow:
                  - $YOUR_PUBLIC_IP
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cloud-agent-endpoint" label="CloudEndpoint + AgentEndpoint">

Insert the new rule above your existing `forward-internal` action to require authentication before forwarding traffic to your internal agent endpoint.

```yaml title="ngrok-crds.yaml"
apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
kind: CloudEndpoint
metadata:
  name: tinyllama-cloud-endpoint
spec:
  url: $YOUR_DOMAIN
  trafficPolicy:
    policy:
      on_http_request:
        - actions:
            - type: restrict-ips
              config:
                enforce: true
                allow:
                  - $YOUR_PUBLIC_IP
        - actions:
          - type: forward-internal
            config:
              url: http://tinyllama.internal
---
apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
kind: AgentEndpoint
metadata:
  name: tinyllama-endpoint
spec:
  url: http://tinyllama.internal
  upstream:
    url: http://tinyllama.default:80
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Re-apply the manifest with `kubectl apply -f ngrok-crds.yaml`.

## 5. Start sending requests
