You can now verify that your Kubernetes service is accessible from the public internet and that your Traffic Policy rules are in place.
If you deployed the `tinyllama` service:

- Chat with the LLM in your browser: `https://$YOUR_DOMAIN`
- Send a completions request to the API: 

	```bash
	curl http://$YOUR_DOMAIN/v1/completions \
		-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
		-d '{
				"model": "tinyllama-1.1b-chat-v1.0.Q5_K_M",
				"prompt": "Why is the sky blue?",
				"max_tokens": 128
			}'
	```
