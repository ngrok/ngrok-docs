You can now verify that your Kubernetes service is accessible from the public internet and that your Traffic Policy rules are in place.
If you deployed the `tinyllama` service:

- Chat with the LLM in your browser: `https://$YOUR_DOMAIN`
- Send a completions request to the API:

  ```bash
  curl http://$YOUR_DOMAIN/v1/completions \
  	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  	-d '{
  			"model": "tinyllama-1.1b-chat-v1.0.Q5_K_M",
  			"prompt": "Why is the sky blue?",
  			"max_tokens": 128
  		}'
  ```
