With Traffic Policy, you can connect your API to ngrok's [event logging system](/docs/obs/) for smarter troubleshooting, testing, and integration of logging services like Datadog for your API gateway and upstream services.

This rule:

1. Checks if the response status code is not in the 200 range
1. Logs the unsuccessful request with a custom message and metadata

<ConfigExample
	config={{
		on_http_request: [
			{
				actions: [
					{
						type: "custom-response",
						config: {
							status_code: 503,
							content:
								"<html><body><h1>Service Unavailable</h1><p>Our servers are currently down for maintenance. Please check back later.</p></body></html>",
							headers: {
								"content-type": "text/html",
							},
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
		on_http_response: [
			{
				name: "Log unsuccessful requests",
				expressions: ["res.status_code < '200' && res.status_code >= '300'"],
				actions: [
					{
						type: "log",
						config: {
							metadata: {
								message: "Unsuccessful request",
								edge_id: "<YOUR-NGROK-DOMAIN>",
								success: false,
							},
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>
