With Traffic Policy, you can use [CEL interpolation](/traffic-policy/concepts/cel-interpolation) to dynamically forward requests to different internal endpoints based on URL request attributes, including but not limited to:

- URL
- hostname
- path
- headers

This allows you to manage complex traffic topologies without manually creating and managing each [`forward-internal` action](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/forward-internal).

This page contains examples of rules that route requests based on different request attributes.

See [the `forward-internal` Traffic Policy action docs](/traffic-policy/actions/forward-internal/) for more information.

## Based on URL

This rule forwards requests from `https://*.example.com` to `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.internal`.

<ConfigExample
	config={{
		on_http_request: [
			{
				name: "Route requests based on URL",
				actions: [
					{
						type: "forward-internal",
						config: {
							url: 'https://${req.host.split(".example.com")[0]}.internal',
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>

## Based on headers

This rule forwards requests containing a `X-Customer-Value: {CUSTOMER}` header to `https://{CUSTOMER}.internal`.

<ConfigExample
	config={{
		on_http_request: {
			actions: [
				{
					type: "forward-internal",
					config: {
						url: "https://${getReqHeader('X-Customer-Value')[0]}.internal",
					},
				},
			],
		},
	}}
/>
