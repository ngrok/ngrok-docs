You can use [CEL
interpolation](/docs/traffic-policy/concepts/cel-interpolation) to
dynamically forward requests to different internal endpoints based on URL
request attributes, including but not limited to:

- URL
- hostname
- path
- headers

This allows you to manage complex traffic
topologies without manually creating and managing each [`forward-internal`
action](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/forward-internal).

## Based on URL

The following example forwards requests from `https://*.example.com` to `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.internal`.

<BasedOnURL />

## Based on headers

The following example forwards requests containing a `X-Customer-Value: {CUSTOMER}` header to `https://{CUSTOMER}.internal`.

<BasedOnHeaders />
