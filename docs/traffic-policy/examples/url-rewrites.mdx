With Traffic Policy, you can map permalinks to "pretty" alternatives that are easier for both humans and [SEO bots](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/googlebot) to understand. This is especially useful for blogs that use a CMS, since the generated permalinks might be affecting your SEO performance.

This rule rewrites a user-friendly URL like
`/blog/11/example-title` to `/blog/index.php?p=11&title=example-title`, which is readable by your CMS.

<ConfigExample
	config={{
		on_http_request: [
			{
				expressions: ["req.url.path.startsWith('/blog')"],
				actions: [
					{
						type: "url-rewrite",
						config: {
							from: "/blog/([0-9]+)/([a-zA-Z]+)/",
							to: "/blog/index.php?p=$1&title=$2",
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>

See [the `url-rewrite` Traffic Policy action docs](/traffic-policy/actions/url-rewrite/) for more information.
