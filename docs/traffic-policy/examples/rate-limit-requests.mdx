With Traffic Policy, you can rate limit requests to your endpoints based on a variety of criteria. This page demonstrates a few example rules that do so.

See [the `rate-limit` Traffic Policy action docs](/traffic-policy/actions/rate-limit/) for more information.

## By endpoint

This rule applies rate limiting of `30` requests per second to the endpoint `/api/videos`.

<ConfigExample
	config={{
		on_http_request: [
			{
				expressions: ["req.url.contains('/api/specific_endpoint')"],
				actions: [
					{
						name: "Only allow 30 requests per minute",
						type: "rate-limit",
						config: {
							algorithm: "sliding_window",
							capacity: 30,
							rate: "60s",
							bucket_key: ["conn.client_ip"],
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>

## Based on authentication status

This rule creates a lower rate limit for unauthenticated (likely free) users, while allowing authenticated users a higher level of capacity.

<ConfigExample
	config={{
		on_http_request: [
			{
				expressions: ["!('Authorization' in req.headers)"],
				name: "Unauthorized rate limiting tier",
				actions: [
					{
						type: "rate-limit",
						config: {
							name: "Allow 10 requests per minute",
							algorithm: "sliding_window",
							capacity: 10,
							rate: "60s",
							bucket_key: ["conn.client_ip"],
						},
					},
				],
			},
			{
				expressions: ["('Authorization' in req.headers)"],
				name: "Authorized rate limiting tier",
				actions: [
					{
						type: "rate-limit",
						config: {
							name: "Allow 100 requests per minute",
							algorithm: "sliding_window",
							capacity: 100,
							rate: "60s",
							bucket_key: ["conn.client_ip"],
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>

## Based on pricing tiers

Using a naming scheme in your upstream servers with API calls using a `tier` header, you can quickly customize access to your API based on any number of pricing tiers.

This rule checks for a `Tier` header in the request and applies rate limiting based on the value of that header.

<ConfigExample
	config={{
		on_http_request: [
			{
				expressions: ["!('Tier' in req.headers)"],
				name: "Free rate limiting tier",
				actions: [
					{
						type: "rate-limit",
						config: {
							name: "Allow 10 requests per minute",
							algorithm: "sliding_window",
							capacity: 10,
							rate: "60s",
							bucket_key: ["conn.client_ip"],
						},
					},
				],
			},
			{
				expressions: [
					"getReqHeader('tier').exists(v, v.matches('(?i)bronze'))",
				],
				name: "Bronze rate limiting tier",
				actions: [
					{
						type: "rate-limit",
						config: {
							name: "Allow 100 requests per minute",
							algorithm: "sliding_window",
							capacity: 100,
							rate: "60s",
							bucket_key: ["conn.client_ip"],
						},
					},
				],
			},
			{
				expressions: [
					"getReqHeader('tier').exists(v, v.matches('(?i)silver'))",
				],
				name: "Bronze rate limiting tier",
				actions: [
					{
						type: "rate-limit",
						config: {
							name: "Allow 1000 requests per minute",
							algorithm: "sliding_window",
							capacity: 1000,
							rate: "60s",
							bucket_key: ["conn.client_ip"],
						},
					},
				],
			},
			{
				expressions: ["getReqHeader('tier').exists(v, v.matches('(?i)gold'))"],
				name: "Gold rate limiting tier",
				actions: [
					{
						type: "rate-limit",
						config: {
							name: "Allow 10000 requests per minute",
							algorithm: "sliding_window",
							capacity: 10000,
							rate: "60s",
							bucket_key: ["conn.client_ip"],
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>
