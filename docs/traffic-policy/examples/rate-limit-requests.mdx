With Traffic Policy, you can rate limit requests to your endpoints based on a variety of criteria. This page demonstrates a few examples of doing so.

## By endpoint

The following example applies rate limiting of `30` requests per second to the endpoint
`/api/videos`.

<RateLimit />

## Based on authentication status

The following example creates a lower rate limit for unauthenticated (likely free) users, while allowing authenticated users a higher level of capacity.

<RateLimitAuthentication />

## Based on pricing tiers

Using a naming scheme in your upstream servers, and API calls using a `tier` header, you can quickly customize access to your API based on any number of pricing tiers.
