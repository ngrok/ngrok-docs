# Traffic Policy Examples

Explore a curated collection of examples and configuration examples spanning from common to unconventional use cases for the Traffic Policy module.

A number of these examples come from a longer article about how ngrok [makes policy management accessible](https://ngrok.com/blog-post/api-gateway-policy-management-examples) to developers, including a simple Go-based application for testing these and other configurations.

## Route requests

### Forward to an internal endpoints based on request attributes

You can use [CEL
interpolation](/docs/traffic-policy/concepts/cel-interpolation) to
dynamically forward requests to different internal endpoints based on URL,
hostname, path, headers, and more. This allows you to manage complex traffic
topologies without manually creating and managing each [`forward-internal`
action](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/forward-internal).

Forward requests from `https://*.example.com` to `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.internal`.

```yaml mode=traffic-policy
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: https://${req.host.split('.example.com')[0]}.internal
```

Forward requsets containing a `X-Customer-Value: {CUSTOMER}` header to `https://{CUSTOMER}.internal`.

```yaml mode=traffic-policy
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: "forward-internal"
        config:
          url: https://${getReqHeader('X-Customer-Value')[0]}.internal
```

## Add authentication

### Add JWT authentication and key-based rate limiting

Building from our [Auth0 guide](/integrations/auth0/jwt-action/), these rules also add rate limiting based on your consumers' JWTs.

<JWTsRateLimiting />

### Conditional Access to a page using oauth variables

<OAuthConditionalAccess />

### Capturing and sending identity token over a header

<OIDCIdentityToken />

## Rate limit requests

### Rate limit for specific endpoint

This rule applies rate limiting of `30` requests per second to the endpoint
`/api/videos`.

<RateLimit />

### Rate limit API consumers based on authentication status

Create a low rate limit for unauthenticated (likely free) users, while allowing authenticated users a higher level of capacity.

<RateLimitAuthentication />

### Rate limit API consumers based on pricing tiers

Using a naming scheme in your upstream servers, and API calls using a `tier` header, you can quickly customize access to your API based on any number of pricing tiers.

<RateLimitPricing />

## Block unwanted requests

### Deny traffic from Tor networks

Use connection variables available in [IP Intelligence](/docs/traffic-policy/variables/ip-intel) to block Tor exit node IPs.

```yaml traffic-policy
on_http_request:
  - expressions:
      - "!('proxy.anonymous.tor' in conn.client_ip.categories)"
    actions:
      - type: deny
        config:
          status_code: 403
```

### Disallow bots and crawlers with a `robots.txt`

This rule returns a custom response with a [`robots.txt` file](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots/intro) to deny search engine or AI crawlers on all paths.

<AddRobotsTxt />

You can also extend the expression above to create specific rules for crawlers based on their user agent strings, like `ChatGPT-User` and `GPTBot`.

<AddRobotsTxtSpecific />

### Block bots and crawlers by user agent

In addition to, or instead of, denying bots and crawlers with a `robots.txt` file, you can also take action on only incoming requests that contain specific strings in the [`req.user_agent` request variable](/docs/http/traffic-policy/expressions/variables.mdx#requser_agent).

You can extend the expression to include additional user agents by extending `(chatgpt-user|gptbot)` like so: `(chatgpt-user|gptbot|anthropic|claude|any|other|user-agent|goes|here)`.

<BlockSpecificBots />

### Deny non-GET requests

This rule denies all inbound traffic that is not a GET request.

<Deny />

### Custom response for unauthorized requests

This rule sends a custom response with status code `401` and body `Unauthorized`
for requests without an Authorization header.

<CustomResponse />

### Block traffic from specific countries

Remain compliant with data regulations or sanctions by blocking requests originating from one or more countries using their respective [ISO country codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes).

<BlockCountries />

### Limit request sizes

Prevent excessively large user uploads, like text or images, that might cause performance or availability issues for your upstream service.

<LimitSize />

## Manipulate headers

### Enrich your upstream service

Add new headers to requests to give your upstream service more context about the
consumer, which in turn allows for richer functionality, such as localized
languages and pricing.

```yaml mode=traffic-policy
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: add-headers
        config:
          headers:
						x-is-ngrok: "1"
            x-endpoint-id: "${endpoint.id}"
            x-client-ip: "${conn.client_ip}"
            x-client-conn-start: "${conn.ts.start}"
            x-client-loc: "${conn.geo.city}, ${conn.geo.country}"
            x-client-path: "${req.url.path}
```

### Remove service details from response headers

Some frameworks, like [Express](https://expressjs.com/), add headers like
`X-Powered-By: Express` to responses, which you may not want to reveal to your
users.

The following example removes the `X-Powered-By` header.

```yaml mode=traffic-policy
on_http_response:
  - actions:
      - type: remove-headers
        config:
          headers:
            - "X-Powered-By"
```

### Deploy simple A/B tests

Using the [`rand.double()`
macro](/docs/traffic-policy/macros/utility#randdouble--double) set to `>=
0.5`, you can equally split incoming requests to two different internal agent
endpoints, which forward traffic to the two versions of your service.

You can manipulate `<= 0.5` to match the percentage of requests to route to your
B test, e.g. `<= 0.1` for 10%.

```yaml mode=traffic-policy
---
on_http_request:
  - expressions:
      - "rand.double() <= 0.5"
    actions:
      - type: "forward-internal"
        config:
          url: https://b.internal
  - actions:
      - type: "forward-internal"
        config:
          url: https://a.internal
```

If you don't have multiple services, you could also route B traffic to a
separate route.

```yaml mode=traffic-policy
---
on_http_request:
  - expressions:
      - "rand.double() <= 0.5"
    actions:
      - type: "url-rewrite"
        config:
					from: "/path/to/test"
          to: "/path/to/test-b"
```

### Create 'pretty' URLs for SEO

You can map the permalinks created by a blog CMS to "pretty" alternatives that
are easier for both humans and [SEO
bots](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/googlebot) to
understand.

The following rule rewrites the a user-friendly URL like
`/blog/11/example-title` to `/blog/index.php?p=11&title=example-title`, which is
readable by your CMS.

```yaml mode=traffic-policy
on_http_request:
  - expressions:
      - "req.url.path.startsWith('/blog')"
    actions:
      - type: "url-rewrite"
        config:
          from: "/blog/([0-9]+)/([a-zA-Z]+)/"
          to: "/blog/index.php?p=$1&title=$2"
```

### User agent filtering

We deliver tailored content to Microsoft Edge users by examining the
`User-Agent` header for the case-insensitive string `(?i)edg/` succeeded by
digits `\d`. To see how this works in practice, explore the following
[regex101 demonstration](https://regex101.com/r/3NPVub/1).

To ensure correct decoding from YAML/JSON, it's necessary to properly escape the
`\d` sequence. In YAML, if your string is not enclosed in quotes, use a single
escape: `\\d`. However, when your string is wrapped in quotes, either in YAML or
JSON, you need to double-escape: `\\\\d` for accurate decoding.

<UserAgentFilter />

### Deprecate an API version

By include a `X-Api-Version` header in your API reference or developer documentation, you can quickly return a helpful error message, which encourages them to explore usage of the new version.

<DeprecateVersion />

### Manipulate request headers

### Add compression

Quickly ensure all JSON responses are [compressed](/docs/http/traffic-policy/actions/compress-response.mdx) en route to your API consumer. If your upstream service already handles compression, ngrok skips this step.

<AddCompression />

### Enforce TLS version

Prevent obsolete and potentially vulnerable browsers, SDKs, or CLI tools like `curl` from attempting to access your API.

<EnforceTLS />

### Log unsuccessful events

Connect your API to ngrok's [event logging system](/docs/obs/index.mdx) for smarter troubleshooting of your API gateway and upstream services.

<LogUnsuccessful />
