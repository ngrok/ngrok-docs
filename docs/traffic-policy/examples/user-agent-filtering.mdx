With Traffic Policy, you can check a request's `User-Agent` header to deliver tailored content to users based on their browser and device, or to customize responses for SEO crawlers and bots.

This rule delivers tailored content to Microsoft Edge users by examining the `User-Agent` header for the case-insensitive string `(?i)edg/` succeeded by digits `\d`. To see how this works in practice, explore the following [regex101 demonstration](https://regex101.com/r/3NPVub/1).

<ConfigExample
	config={{
		on_http_request: [
			{
				expressions: [
					"'user-agent' in req.headers",
					"size(req.headers['user-agent'].filter(x, x.matches('(?i).*Edg/\\\\d+.*'))) > 0",
				],
				actions: [
					{
						type: "custom-response",
						config: {
							status_code: 200,
							content: "Hello Edge User!",
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>

:::tip
To ensure correct decoding from YAML/JSON, it's necessary to properly escape the `\d` sequence. In YAML, if your string is not enclosed in quotes, use a single escape: `\\d`. However, when your string is wrapped in quotes, either in YAML or JSON, you need to double-escape: `\\\\d` for accurate decoding.
