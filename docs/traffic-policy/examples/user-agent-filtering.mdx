With Traffic Policy, we automatically parse out useful information from the request's `User-Agent` header and make them [available as variables](/traffic-policy/variables/req/#requser_agentname). You can use them to deliver tailored content to users based on their browser and device, or to customize or block for SEO crawlers and bots.

This rule delivers tailored content to Microsoft Edge users by matching on the `req.user_agent.name` value.

<ConfigExample
	config={{
		on_http_request: [
			{
				expressions: [
					"req.user_agent.name == 'Edge'",
				],
				actions: [
					{
						type: "custom-response",
						config: {
							status_code: 200,
							body: "Hello Edge User!",
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>

You can also quickly block bots from your site by denying them by user-agent using the handy boolean flag.

<ConfigExample
	config={{
		on_http_request: [
			{
				expressions: [
					"req.user_agent.is_bot",
				],
				actions: [
					{
						type: "deny",
						config: {
							status_code: 403
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>

Check out the [ngrok variable documentation](/traffic-policy/variables/req/#requser_agentname) for all the values you can use in your policy.
