With Traffic Policy, you can block unwanted requests to your endpoints. This page demonstrates a few example rules that do so.

See the following Traffic Policy action docs for more information:

- [`deny`](/traffic-policy/actions/deny/)
- [`custom-response`](/traffic-policy/actions/custom-response/)

## Deny traffic from Tor networks

This rule uses the [connection variables](/traffic-policy/variables/connection/) available in [IP Intelligence](/traffic-policy/variables/ip-intel) to block [Tor](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(network)>) exit node IPs.

<ConfigExample
	config={{
		on_http_request: [
			{
				expressions: ["!('proxy.anonymous.tor' in conn.client_ip.categories)"],
				actions: [
					{
						type: "deny",
						config: {
							status_code: 403,
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>

## Block bots and crawlers with a `robots.txt`

This rule returns a custom response with a [`robots.txt` file](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots/intro) to deny search engine or [AI crawlers](https://platform.openai.com/docs/bots/) on all paths.

<ConfigExample
	config={{
		on_http_request: [
			{
				name: "Add `robots.txt` to deny all bots and crawlers",
				expressions: ["req.url.contains('/robots.txt')"],
				actions: [
					{
						type: "custom-response",
						config: {
							status_code: 200,
							content: "User-agent: *\r\nDisallow: /",
							headers: {
								"content-type": "text/plain",
							},
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>

You can extend this example to create specific rules for crawlers based on their user agent strings, like [`ChatGPT-User` and `GPTBot`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/bots).

<ConfigExample
	config={{
		on_http_request: [
			{
				name: "Add `robots.txt` to deny specific bots and crawlers",
				expressions: ["req.url.contains('/robots.txt')"],
				actions: [
					{
						type: "custom-response",
						config: {
							status_code: 200,
							content: "User-agent: ChatGPT-User\\r\\nDisallow: /",
							headers: {
								"content-type": "text/plain",
							},
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>

## Block bots and crawlers by user agent

You can also take action on incoming requests that contain specific strings in [the `req.user_agent` request variable](/http/request-headers/#http).

<ConfigExample
	config={{
		on_http_request: [
			{
				name: "Block specific bots by user agent",
				expressions: [
					"req.user_agent.matches('(?i).*(chatgpt-user|gptbot)/\\\\d+.*')",
				],
				actions: [
					{
						type: "deny",
						config: {
							status_code: 404,
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>

:::tip

You can expand the expression to include additional user agents by extending the `(chatgpt-user|gptbot)` section of the regular expression.

```bash
(chatgpt-user|gptbot|anthropic|claude|any|other|user-agent|goes|here)
```

:::

## Deny non-GET requests

This rule denies all inbound traffic that is not a GET request.

<ConfigExample
	config={{
		on_http_request: [
			{
				expressions: ["req.method != 'GET'"],
				actions: [{ type: "deny" }],
			},
		],
	}}
/>

## Custom response for unauthorized requests

This rule sends a custom response with status code `401` and body `Unauthorized` for requests without an Authorization header.

<ConfigExample
	config={{
		on_http_request: [
			{
				expressions: ["!('authorization' in req.headers)"],
				actions: [
					{
						type: "custom-response",
						config: {
							status_code: 401,
							content: "Unauthorized",
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>

## Block traffic from specific countries

Sometimes you may need to block requests originating from one or more countries to remain compliant with data regulations or sanctions. This rule blocks requests based on the origin country using [ISO country codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes) with the following steps:

1. Check if the request is from an array of countries you can define
1. If so, return a `401` status code with an error message.

<ConfigExample
	config={{
		on_http_request: [
			{
				expressions: [
					"conn.geo.country_code in ['<COUNTRY-01>', '<COUNTRY-02>']",
				],
				name: "Block traffic from unwanted countries",
				actions: [
					{
						type: "custom-response",
						config: {
							status_code: 401,
							content: "Unauthorized request due to country of origin.",
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>

## Limit request sizes

This rule demonstrates how to prevent excessively large user uploads, like text or images, that might cause performance or availability issues for your upstream service with the following steps:

1. Check if the request is `POST` or `PUT
1. Check if the request's content is 1MB or larger.
1. If both conditions are met, return a `400` status code with an error message.

<ConfigExample
	config={{
		on_http_request: [
			{
				name: "Block large POST/PUT requests.",
				expressions: [
					"req.method == 'POST' || req.method == 'PUT'",
					"req.content_length >= 1000",
				],
				actions: [
					{
						type: "custom-response",
						config: {
							status_code: 400,
							content: "Error: You can't upload content larger than 1MB.",
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>
