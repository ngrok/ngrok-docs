With at least two endpoints and Traffic Policy, you can run simple A/B tests with using the [`rand.double()` macro](/docs/traffic-policy/macros/utility#randdouble--double).

## Basic example

This rule:

1. Uses `rand.double()` to generate a random `double` between 0 and 1 when traffic reaches the endpoint
1. Checks if the value is greater than or equal to 0.5
1. If so, it routes the traffic to a different [internal agent endpoint](/universal-gateway/internal-endpoints/).

<ConfigExample
	config={{
		on_http_request: [
			{
				expressions: ["rand.double() <= 0.5"],
				actions: [
					{
						type: "forward-internal",
						config: {
							url: "https://a.internal",
						},
					},
					{
						type: "forward-internal",
						config: {
							url: "https://b.internal",
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>

:::tip
You can change the value the random number is checked against to split the traffic in different ratios. For example,`>=0.8` would send 80% of the traffic to one endpoint and 20% to the other.

See [the `forward-internal` Traffic Policy action docs](/traffic-policy/actions/forward-internal/) for more information.

## Using rewrites

You can also send the traffic to a different route.

<ConfigExample
	config={{
		on_http_request: [
			{
				expressions: ["rand.double() <= 0.5"],
				actions: [
					{
						type: "url-rewrite",
						config: {
							from: "/path/to/test",
							to: "/path/to/test-b",
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>

See [the URL Rewrite Example](/docs/traffic-policy/examples/url-rewrites) for another example using rewrites.
