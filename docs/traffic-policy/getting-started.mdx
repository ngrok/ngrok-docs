# Getting Started with Traffic Policy

## Prerequisites

1. **ngrok Account** - Ensure you have an active [ngrok](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/) account.
2. **ngrok Agent** - Download and install the [ngrok agent](https://ngrok.com/download) for your operating system.

## Step 1: Create a Traffic Policy

Create a custom traffic policy by saving the following YAML configuration as `policy.yml`:

```
on_http_request:
  - actions:
    - type: custom-response
      config:
        content: "Hello, World!"
```

This policy will respond to each HTTP request with a simple “Hello, World!” message.

## Step 2: Apply Your Traffic Policy

Run the agent, applying the traffic policy you saved in the previous step with the `--traffic-policy-file` flag:

```
$ ngrok http 80 --traffic-policy-file policy.yml
```

This command starts an HTTP tunnel for port `80`, using the specified `policy.yml` traffic policy to manage traffic.

## Step 3: Test it out

After running the ngrok command in the previous step you should now see a URL in the forwarding section. Open the URL
in your web browser. You should see the "Hello, World!" message displayed in your browser.

# Next Steps

**🎉 Congratulations!** 

You've successfully set up your first endpoint with a custom traffic policy using the ngrok agent.
