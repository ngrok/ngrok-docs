# Macros

ngrok offers a variety of CEL macros that can be used within the Traffic Policy engine to simplify [traffic management](../concepts/expressions) and [dynamic configuration](../concepts/cel-interpolation). These macros help you streamline traffic handling by referencing common values and conditions.

## Available Macros

- [**Core Macros**](./core): Macros built into CEL.
- [**Ext Macros**](./ext): Macros from the [cel-go/ext](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/google/cel-go/ext) package.
- [**HTTP Macros**](./http): Macros specifically designed for HTTP traffic.
- [**Utility Macros**](./utility): Additional macros that provide extra functionality.

You can use these macros in combination with [expressions](../concepts/expressions) and [actions](../actions) to create dynamic, condition-based traffic flows.
