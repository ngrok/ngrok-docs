:::tip Early Access
This feature is currently in Early Access. Log into the [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/developer-preview) to request access.

Security Macros allow you to access sensitive information directly in your Traffic Policies. Your ngrok account has a Vault that can store Secrets. Any secrets that you add to your vault will be available across your account on all traffic policies. Updates to these secrets will be reflected across all traffic policies automatically.

## How secrets are secured

- Secrets are protected at rest using industry standard `AES-256` encryption
- ngrok's REST API does not return secrets as part of any of its response payloads
- REST API traffic is encrypted in-transit using `HTTP/S` and `TLS 1.2+`

## Get started

To get started, first create a vault.

:::note
This example uses [the ngrok CLI's `api` command](/docs/agent/api/), but you can also use the REST API directly. [Install the ngrok CLI](/getting-started/).
:::

```bash
ngrok api vaults create --name "example-vault" --description "example vault for my secrets"
```

You should get a response similar to the following:

```json
201 Created
{
  "created_at": "2026-06-11T21:05:23Z",
  "created_by": "usr_abc123xyz456",
  "description": "example vault for my secrets",
  "id": "vault_xyz123abc456",
  "last_updated_by": "usr_abc123xyz456",
  "name": "example-vault",
  "updated_at": "2026-06-11T21:05:23Z",
  "uri": "https://api.ngrok.com/vaults/vault_abc123"
}
```

Then, create your secret, using the `id` from the response as the `--vault-id`:

```bash
ngrok api secrets create --name "example-basic-auth" --description "example basic auth user pass" --value "admin:strongpassword" --vault-id "vault_xyz123abc456"
```

Then, you could use the secret in a [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/) like this:

```yaml
on_http_request:
  - name: basic-auth-example
    actions:
      - type: basic-auth
        config:
          realm: sample-realm
          credentials:
            - \${secret('example-vault','example-basic-auth')}
          enforce: true
```

## Using secrets in you Kubernetes deployment

Vaults and secrets can be used in traffic policies in conjunction with Kubernetes Operator. Vaults and Secrets must be created using the ngrok API (either through REST or via the CLI).

You can use your secrets with your Kubernetes deployment via Traffic Policy. See [the Kubernetes Operator quickstart](/getting-started/kubernetes/ingress) to learn more.

## Macros

### `secret(string, string) -> string`

Takes the vault name as the first argument and the secret name as the second argument. Returns the secret value.

#### Example

```yaml
secret("vault-name", "secret-name")
```

| Plan     | Vault Limit       | Secret Limit (across all vaults) | Notes                                                                             |

| Pro      | 5                 | 25                               | All values are fixed. If you need more vaults/secrets, move to Paygo.             |
| Business | 5 (default limit) | 500 (default limit)              | Contact us if you need more vaults/secrets than default limits.                   |
