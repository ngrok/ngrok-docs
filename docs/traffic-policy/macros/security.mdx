Security Macros allow you to access sensitive information directly in your Traffic Policies. Your ngrok account has a Vault that can store Secrets. Any secrets that you add to your vault will be available across your account on all traffic policies. Updates to these secrets will be reflected across all traffic policies automatically.

## How secrets are secured

- Secrets are protected at rest using industry standard `AES-256` encryption
- ngrok's REST API does not return secrets as part of any of its response payloads
- REST API traffic is encrypted in-transit using `HTTP/S` and `TLS 1.2+`

## Get started

This section will walk you through creating a vault and secret. This example uses [the ngrok CLI's](/getting-started/) `api` command, but you can also use the REST API directly. .

```bash
ngrok api vaults create --name "example-vault" --description "example vault for my secrets"
```

You should get a response similar to the following:

```json
{
  "created_at": "2026-06-11T21:05:23Z",
  "created_by": "usr_abc123xyz456",
  "description": "example vault for my secrets",
  "id": "vault_xyz123abc456",
  "last_updated_by": "usr_abc123xyz456",
  "name": "example-vault",
  "updated_at": "2026-06-11T21:05:23Z",
  "uri": "https://api.ngrok.com/vaults/vault_abc123"
}
```

Then, create your secret, using the `id` from the response as the `--vault-id`:

```bash
ngrok api secrets create --name "example-basic-auth" --description "example basic auth user pass" --value "admin:strongpassword" --vault-id "vault_xyz123abc456"
```

Then, you could use the secret in a [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/) like this:

```yaml
on_http_request:
  - name: basic-auth-example
    actions:
      - type: basic-auth
        config:
          realm: sample-realm
          credentials:
            - \${secret('example-vault','example-basic-auth')}
          enforce: true
```

### Using secrets in you Kubernetes deployment

Vaults and secrets can be used in traffic policies in conjunction with Kubernetes Operator. Vaults and Secrets must be created using the ngrok API (either through REST or via the CLI).

You can use your secrets with your Kubernetes deployment via Traffic Policy. See [the Kubernetes Operator quickstart](/getting-started/kubernetes/ingress) to learn more.

## Macros

### `secret(string, string) -> string`

Takes the vault name as the first argument and the secret name as the second argument. Returns the secret value.

#### Example

```yaml
secret("vault-name", "secret-name")
```
