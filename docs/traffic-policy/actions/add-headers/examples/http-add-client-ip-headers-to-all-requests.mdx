### Adding Client IP Headers to all HTTP requests

The following configuration will add the client IP address to all HTTP requests.

#### Example Traffic Policy Document

<ConfigExample
  snippetText={null}
  showLineNumbers={true}
  yamlMetastring="{4-7}"
  jsonMetastring="{5-12}"
  config={{
    inbound: [{
      actions: [
        {
          type: "add-headers",
          config: {
            headers: {
              "x-client-ip": "${conn.client_ip}",
            },
          },
        },
      ],
    }]
  }}
/>

For this example, we are assuming that ngrok is pointing at the upstream service 
https://httpbin.org and we are adding the following header to all requests:

- `x-client-ip` with the value `${conn.client_ip}` to demonstrate the use of 
string interpolation to include the client IP address.

#### Example Request

```shell
$ curl -i https://httpbin.ngrok.app/get
< HTTP/2 200 

{
...
    "X-Client-Ip": "2600:1700:4fa6:1a00:2051:938:7373:5563",
...
}
```
