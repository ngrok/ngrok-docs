# Actions

Actions enable you to manage, control, secure, and modify traffic on your endpoints.

## How Actions Work

Actions are defined on rules in a phase, such as `on_tcp_connect`, with each phase rule supporting
multiple actions. Each phase rule can also include conditions, ensuring actions execute only when
the specified condition evaluates to true. If no conditions are set, the phase rule is considered
true by default and the system will attempt to execute all actions on the phase rule.

Certain actions can "short-circuit" a phase, immediately returning a response to the client without further
processing. This can be particularly useful for scenarios like denying unwanted traffic before it reaches your upstream
server or sending a custom-response with mock data for an API endpoint that hasn't been built yet.

## List of Available Actions

The following actions are available for use on your endpoints:
