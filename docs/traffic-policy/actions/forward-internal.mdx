The `forward-internal` Traffic Policy action enables you to forward traffic from an endpoint to a internal endpoint within the same ngrok account. This is useful for safely and securely routing traffic from your public endpoints to other services, giving you the ability to choose when and how your endpoints are made publicly available.

### Basic Example

This example configuration will set up a public endpoint (`forward-internal-example.ngrok.io`) forwarding all traffic it receives to a internal endpoint (`example.internal`) that forwards the request to port `80` on your local machine. Since it is forwarding all traffic to the internal endpoint, no traffic will be sent to `8080` which is the upstream port for the public endpoint.

#### Example Traffic Policy Document

<ConfigExample
	snippetText={null}
	showLineNumbers={true}
	jsonMetastring="{5-51}"
	yamlMetastring="{4-28}"
	config={{
		on_http_request: [
			{
				actions: [
					{
						type: "forward-internal",
						config: {
							url: "https://example.internal",
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>

#### Start an Internal Endpoint

```shell
ngrok http 80 --url example.internal
```

#### Start Public Endpoint with Traffic Policy

```shell
ngrok http 8080 --url forward-internal-example.ngrok.io --traffic-policy-file /path/to/policy.yml
```

### Example Request

```shell
$ curl https://forward-internal-example.ngrok.io -v
 ...
> GET / HTTP/2
> Host: forward-internal-example.ngrok.io
> User-Agent: curl/[version]
> Accept: */*
...
```

This request will be forwarded to the internal endpoint `https://example.internal` which will then forward the request to port `80` on your local machine.

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: forward-internal-example.ngrok.io
User-Agent: curl/[version]
Accept: */*
X-Forwarded-For: [ngrok IP]
X-Forwarded-Host: forward-internal-example.ngrok.io
X-Forwarded-Proto: https
Accept-Encoding: gzip
```
