# Getting Started with Agent Endpoints and Traffic Policy via Configuration File

The following getting started guide will take you through starting an Agent Endpoint with a Traffic Policy applied via the [Agent Configuration File](/docs/agent/config/). Note, this guide requires that your agent configuration file is set to [v3](/docs/agent/config/v3).

## Prerequisites

1. **ngrok Account** - Ensure you have an active [ngrok](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/) account.
2. **ngrok Agent** - Download and install the [ngrok agent](https://ngrok.com/download) for your operating system.

## Step 1: Edit your ngrok Configuration File

Enter the following command into your terminal:

```bash
ngrok config edit
```

You should now be editing your configuration file, append the following content to your config file at the bottom and save the file:

```yaml
endpoints:
  - name: my-agent-endpoint
    description: My first Agent Endpoint with a Traffic Policy
    upstream:
      url: 80
    traffic_policy:
      on_http_request:
        - actions:
            - type: custom-response
              config:
                status_code: 200
                content: Hello, World!
```

This policy will respond to each HTTP request with a simple ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù message.

:::note

Your configuration file `version` must be set to `3`.

:::

## Step 2: Start your Agent Endpoint

Start your Agent Endpoint by running the following command:

```bash
ngrok start my-agent-endpoint
```

This command will start an HTTP tunnel for port `80`, using the specified traffic policy in the config file to manage traffic.

## Step 3: Test it out

After running the ngrok command in the previous step you should now see a URL in the forwarding section. Open the URL in your web browser. You should see the "Hello, World!" message displayed in your browser.

# Next Steps

**üéâ Congratulations!**

You've successfully set up your first Agent Endpoint with a custom Traffic Policy using the ngrok agent configuration file.
