# Getting Started with Cloud Endpoints and Traffic Policy via API

## Prerequisites

1. **ngrok Account** - Ensure you have an active [ngrok](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/) account.
2. **ngrok Agent** - Download and install the [ngrok agent](https://ngrok.com/download) for your operating system.
3. **ngrok API Key** - Create an [API key](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/api-keys) via the dashboard.
4. **A Reserved Domain** - You'll need to [reserve a domain](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains) via the dashboard.

## Step 1: Add your API key to the Agent

Create an [API key on your ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/api-keys) and then run the following in your terminal:

```bash
ngrok config add-api-key <your-api-key>
```

## Step 2: Create your Traffic Policy file

Create a file named `policy.yml` with the following contents:

```yaml
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: custom-response
        config:
          status_code: 200
          content: "Hello, World!"
```

This will be the Traffic Policy used on your Cloud Endpoint to respond to each HTTP request with a simple ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù message.

## Step 3: Create your Cloud Endpoint via API

Create your Cloud Endpoint via the API by running the following in your terminal (make sure to replace `<your-reserve-domain>` with your reserved domain):

```bash
ngrok api endpoints create \
  --url https://<your-reserve-domain> \
  --traffic-policy "$(<policy.yml)"
```

## Step 4: Test it out

Once you have created your Cloud Endpoint you can now open the URL
in your web browser. You should see the "Hello, World!" message displayed in your browser.

# Next Steps

**üéâ Congratulations!**

You've successfully set up your first Cloud Endpoint with a custom Traffic Policy via the API.
