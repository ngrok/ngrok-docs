# Phase Rules

Each Phase is made up of Phase Rules. Phase Rules allow you to define how traffic is filtered and processed within a phase. To do this each rule consists of two key parts: **expressions** and **actions**.

Here is an example:

```yaml
on_tcp_connect:
  - expressions:
      - conn.client_ip == '192.168.1.200'
    actions:
      - type: deny
```

## Expressions

Expressions are conditions written in [Common Expression Language (CEL)](https://github.com/google/cel-spec) that can be used to evaluate specific traffic attributes, such as the client IP, request URL, or HTTP method. These conditions determine whether a rule applies to a given traffic flow. For instance, an expression like `conn.client_ip == '192.168.1.200'` targets requests from a specific IP address.

You can define multiple expressions, which are automatically combined using the `&&` operator. This means all expressions in the list must evaluate to `true` for the associated rules to run. If no expressions are provided, the system defaults to `true`, ensuring the rule matches all traffic, and the specified actions are executed in sequence.

By combining multiple conditions, you can craft highly specific and flexible rules to manage traffic effectively.

## Actions

Actions define the behavior that is applied when the expressions evaluate to true. Each action specifies a particular operation to be applied, such as denying traffic, modifying headers, or redirecting requests. Actions are executed sequentially as defined in the policy, but note that some actions can short-circuit the request and return without executing subsequent actions.

For example, the following action denies traffic and returns a `404` HTTP status code:

```yaml
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: "deny"
        config:
          status_code: 404
```

For a full list of actions, check out our [Action Hub](../actions).

## Chaining Rules and Priority

Multiple rules can be defined within a single phase. Rules are evaluated in the order they are defined, and their execution depends on the type of actions taken. For example:

- Some actions (e.g., `deny`) immediately stop further rule evaluation.
- Others (e.g., `url-rewrite`) allow subsequent rules to apply.

This flexibility enables layered and powerful traffic policies.
