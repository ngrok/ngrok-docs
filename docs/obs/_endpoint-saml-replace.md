| force_authn         | boolean            | If true, indicates that whenever we redirect a user to the IdP for authentication that the IdP must prompt the user for authentication credentials even if the user already has a valid session with the IdP.                                                                                              |
| allow_idp_initiated | boolean            | If true, the IdP may initiate a login directly (e.g. the user does not need to visit the endpoint first and then be redirected).

| authorized_groups   | List&lt;string&gt; | If present, only users who are a member of one of the listed groups may access the target endpoint.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| nameid_format       | string             | Defines the name identifier format the SP expects the IdP to use in its assertions to identify subjects. If unspecified, a default value of `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent` will be used. A subset of the allowed values enumerated by the SAML specification are supported.        |
