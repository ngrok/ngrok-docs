# Observability

## Overview

Whenever changes occur in your ngrok account or when traffic transits through
your endpoints, an event is fired. You may subscribe to these events, filter
them to those relevant to you and publish them to any number of destinations.

ngrok's event system was designed for three primary use cases:

- Sending logs of your ngrok traffic to logging services like Datadog and
  CloudWatch Logs
- Sending audit logs of ngrok configurations changes to your SIEM
- Enabling you to programmatically respond to events on your ngrok account

There are [over 40 event types published](/docs/obs/reference) via ngrok at the time of writing.
They break down into two important classes of event:

- **[Audit Events](/docs/obs/reference/#audit-events)**: Changes to your account like create/update/delete of Domains, API Keys, IP Policies, etc.
- **[Traffic Events](/docs/obs/reference/#traffic-events)**: When traffic transits through your endpoints like processing an HTTP request or TCP connection

## Concepts

ngrok's event logging system is composed of three simple primitives. You create
an **Event Subscription** to _subscribe_ to a set of **Event Sources** and
_publish_ those events to one or more **Event Destinations**.

- **[Event Subscriptions](#subscriptions)**: Define which Event
  Sources to capture and which Event Destinations to publish to.
- **[Event Sources](#sources)**: The event types a subscription captures and
  optionally a set of fields to record and a boolean filter expression
- **[Event Destinations](#destinations)**: Where events are sent, e.g.
  Datadog, CloudWatch, Kinesis.

## Quickstart

You can create your first Event Subscription on the [Events page of your ngrok
Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/events/subscriptions) to being capturing
and publishing events.

We also publish guides to get started with each of ngrok's Event Destinations:

- **[Datadog Logs](/docs/integrations/datadog/event-destination/)**
- **[AWS CloudWatch Logs](/docs/integrations/amazon-cloudwatch/event-destination/)**
- **[AWS Firehose](/docs/integrations/amazon-firehose/event-destination/)**
- **[AWS Kinesis](/docs/integrations/amazon-kinesis/event-destination/)**

## Event Subscriptions {#subscriptions}

Event subscriptions define which Event Sources to capture and which
destinations to publish to. If you're familiar with other event systems, they may
call this a _listener_, a _hook_, a _probe_ or a _tap_.

When you create an Event Subscription, you select:

- One or more Event Sources to subscribe to
- One or more Event Destinations to publish the subscribed events to

Event Subscriptions can be created on the [ngrok
Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/events/subscriptions) or via the [
Event Subscription API Resource](/api/resources/event-subscriptions/#create-event-subscription).

## Event Sources {#sources}

Event Sources choose which events an Event Subscription captures. Other event
systems may call this a _selector_.

There are two categories of event sources.

- **[Audit Events](/docs/obs/reference/#audit-events)**:
  Changes to your account like create/update/delete of Domains, API Keys, IP
  Policies, etc.
- **[Traffic Events](/docs/obs/reference/#traffic-events)**:
  When traffic transits through your endpoints like processing an HTTP request or
  TCP connection

Traffic Events support the ability to select exactly which fields you'd like to
include in the captured event. This provides you with control over how much
data is logged to the destinations.

Traffic Events also support the ability to be **filtered**. As part of the Event Source
definition you specify a CEL expression which is evaluated against each event
to determine if it should be captured. See the [Filters](#filters) section
for further detail.

The [ngrok Event Sources reference](/obs/reference) documents the full list
of Event Sources and their fields.

### Versioning and Payload Stability

Event Sources include a version number in their name. Each Event Source ends
with a version string after a dot, e.g. `api_key_created.v0`.

New fields may be added to the payloads of an Event Source without a version
change. Any other change to the event representation will lead to the
introduction of a new version of the Event Source.

### Filters {#filters}

You may specify a filter on the Event Sources of **[Traffic
Events](/docs/obs/reference/#traffic-events)**. Filters are a boolean
expression defined in [Google's Common Expression Language
(CEL)](https://github.com/google/cel-spec/blob/master/doc/langdef.md#standard).
Filters are evaluated on each event as it is published to determine whether it
should be sent to the Event Subscription's destinations.

Traffic Events are often high cardinality. We support filters because you may
only interested in logging a subset of traffic (e.g. specific client IPs).
Filters also enable you to control spend on downstream destinations where you
incur costs based on the quantity of data processed and stored.

The event object is made available to the CEL filter expression as the `ev`
variable. `ev` corresponds to the `object` field of the captured event. Use
standard [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) syntax to access
the fields of the event you want to use in your filters.

Filter expressions have the following limitations:

- Only some fields of an event are available in the `ev` object. The Event
  Source's reference documentation will specify whether a field may be evaluated
  in a filter expression.
- Event metadata fields like `principal` or `event_timestamp` are not available

#### Filter Examples

###### Filter for connections from a particular hostname

    ev.conn.server_name.matches("ngrok-docs-examples\\.ngrok\\.dev")

###### Filter for connections to an endpoint that didn't use HTTPS

    ev.conn.server_name.matches(".*-your-org\\.ngrok\\.dev") &&
    ev.conn.server_port == 80

###### Filter for connections to a hostname that exclude traffic from a client IP

    ev.conn.client_ip != "2601:0:8200:0:4cd7:fd52:0:7823" &&
    ev.conn.server_name == "ngrok-docs-examples.ngrok.dev"

## Event Destinations {#destinations}

An Event Destination encapsulates the configuration to publish events to other
systems. Other event systems may call this a _sink_.

Event Destinations are typically third-party logging aggregators. The following
destinations are currently supported:

- [Amazon CloudWatch](/docs/integrations/amazon-cloudwatch/event-destination/)
- [Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose](/docs/integrations/amazon-firehose/event-destination/)
- [Amazon Kinesis](/docs/integrations/amazon-kinesis/event-destination/)
- AWS S3 (via Kinesis Firehose)
- [Datadog Logs](/docs/integrations/datadog/event-destination/)

Each destination requires provider-specific configuration. If you create a
destination in the ngrok dashboard, you'll be prompted to send a test event to
verify the integration.

When configuring AWS destinations you'll be prompted to optionally download a
small helper script which will automatically configure the appropriate IAM
objects necessary for integration. You may also set these values up via the AWS
Console or tools like Terraform or Pulumi.

Amazon S3 is not a directly supported destination. Instead, configure Amazon Kinesis
Data Firehose to [deliver events into an S3
bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/create-destination.html#create-destination-s3).

## Event Payloads

Events are serialized as JSON when they are published to a destination.

Events include the following fields:

| Name              | Description                                                                 | Example                          |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `account_id`      | unique identifier for the account, always prefixed with ac\_                | `ac_2OtNvAlhso10Gx6s7eupzX3F98q` |
| `event_id`        | unique identifier for this event, always prefixed with ev\_                 | `ev_1vPlyBW3OR44bpPphS4HIZyajDD` |
| `event_type`      | identifies the object, action, and version of the event                     | `ip_policy_created.v0`           |
| `event_timestamp` | timestamp of when the event fired in RFC 3339 format                        | `2021-07-16T21:44:37Z`           |
| `object`          | the event object                                                            | See examples below               |
| `principal`       | an object of the principal who actioned this event, null for traffic events | See example below                |

The `object` property of the event is distinct for each Event Source.

For [Audit Events](/obs/reference#audit-events), the `object`
representation is identical to its API resource at the time of capture.

[Traffic Events](/obs/reference#traffic-events) define their own `object`
representation because they have no corresponding API resource definition.

#### Principal Object

The `principal` object in every event describe the user or bot user responsible
for initiating the event. Principal is defined for all Audit Events
and it is `null` for Traffic Events.

| Name       | Description                                                                                       | Example                                                                                                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| id         | unique identifier for the principal, either a user or bot                                         | `usr_2OtNv9qH5Nk4NuNeszZ39gBxZ4H`                                                                                 |
| subject    | human readable unique identifier for the principal, either a user email or a bot user name        | `foo@example.com`                                                                                                 |
| source     | where the principal initiated the event, either 'Dashboard' or 'API'                              | `API`                                                                                                             |
| credential | id and uri resource for the credential used for authentication, `null` if `source` is 'Dashboard' | `{"id": "ak_2Oxt94wYsBTLwFUoMZcJRvJTaub","uri": "https://api.ngrok.com/api_keys/ak_2Oxt94wYsBTLwFUoMZcJRvJTaub"}` |
