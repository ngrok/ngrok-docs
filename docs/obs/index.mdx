# Traffic Observability

ngrok provides two powerful mechanisms that allow you to observe and introspect
the network traffic flowing through your Endpoints. An in-dashboard real-time
view of requests and a fully-fledged event system to export events to your own
logging systems.

## Traffic Inspector

Traffic Inspector gives you a view into the HTTP traffic flowing through the
endpoints in your account. You can choose whether Traffic Inspector captures
only request metadata or full request and response bodies. You can even replay
requests against your endpoints for easy debugging replication.

## Log Exporting

Whenever changes occur in your ngrok account or when traffic transits through
your endpoints, an event is fired. You may subscribe to these events and
publish them to destinations like AWS Cloudwatch Logs, AWS Firehose, AWS S3,
Datadog Logs, Azure Monitor and more.
