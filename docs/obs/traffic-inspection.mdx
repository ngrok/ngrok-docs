# Traffic Inspection

## Overview

One of the main advantages of using ngrok is the ability to view the traffic going
to your origin service. This can help in triaging tough bugs or testing new capabilities.

ngrok offers multiple ways to inspect the traffic going to your service.

| [ngrok Agent Local Traffic Inspector](/docs/agent/web-inspection-interface/) | This is available when working with the standalone agent and is usually found at http://localhost:4040. Look for a link in your ngrok agent console.                                      |
| [ngrok Traffic Inspector](#ngrok-traffic-inspector)                          | A cloud based version of the local traffic inspector that is available in your [ngrok Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/observability/traffic-insights). See below for more details. |

## ngrok Traffic Inspector

:::note

ngrok Traffic Inspector is currently in developer preview and only available to
specific customers. While in developer preview, you will not be charged for its usage, things will change and break
without notice, and data may be lost at any time. If you have feedback or questions
please [reach out to the product team](mailto:support@ngrok.com?subject=Traffic%20Insights%20Feedback).

## Full Capture mode

By default, the ngrok Traffic Inspector will only store the metadata about each request and response. Full Capture mode is an opt-in setting on your ngrok account that will store the full request and response parameters, headers, and bodies for each traffic event that flows through your endpoints.
This can be enabled by account admins by visiting the Observability section in the [ngrok Settings Page](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/settings#observability) after logging in.

:::warning

Storing the full request and response data may mean you and your team members have access to sensitive data flowing through your endpoints.

:::

Once full capture mode is enabled, ngrok will begin capturing and storing the full requests and responses up to a maximum of 10KB, after which the data will be truncated. Header values will be truncated after 1KB for each value.
Data that is truncated will be indicated in the Traffic Inspector through the number of bytes that were captured as well as the number of headers.

This data is stored for your retention period of your account, currently set at 3 days from the time a request is received.

## Replay

Replaying requests allows users to re-send an HTTP request upstream without directly accessing the endpoint. To use replay, you must activate Full Capture mode in your account.

Once Full Capture is enabled, a replay button will appear for fully captured requests in the traffic event details pane of the dashboard. If this button is unavailable, it likely indicates that the request occurred before Full Capture was fully activated, or the request was too large and has been truncated.

When replaying a request to your service, we aim to make minimal changes. However, some alterations are inevitable. Here's a list of changes we make to replayed requests:

- The replayed request will originate from a different IP address, so any IP restrictions may prevent the replay from reaching your upstream.
- We remove any `Connection: Keep-Alive` headers as replay does not support them.
- Some request bodies might not be captured, even if they were replayed successfully. This is particularly true for traffic events with an error status code.
- We add a custom ngrok header `Ngrok-Replay-Original-Request-ID` that contains the ID of the original request. This allows you to trace back to the original request if needed.
- If the request has been truncated, we can't replay it.
- We can't replay the request if the HTTP method is unknown or undefined.
- The `X-forwarded` header values are substituted with accurate values for the replay, not the original request.

## Replay with Changes (Coming Soon)

ngrok Traffic Inspector allows you to edit the request before re-sending it to your backend.
