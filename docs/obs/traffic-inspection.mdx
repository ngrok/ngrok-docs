# Traffic Inspection

## Overview

One of the main advantages of using ngrok is the ability to view the traffic going
to your origin service. This can help in triaging tough bugs or testing new capabilities.

ngrok offers multiple ways to inspect the traffic going to your service.

## ngrok Traffic Inspector

:::note

ngrok Traffic Inspector is currently in developer preview and only available to
specific customers. While in developer preview, you will not be charged for its usage, things will change and break
without notice, and data may be lost at any time. If you have feedback or questions
please [reach out to the product team](mailto:support@ngrok.com?subject=Traffic%20Insights%20Feedback).

:::

## Full Capture mode

By default, the ngrok Traffic Inspector will only store the metadata about each request and response. Full Capture mode is an opt-in setting on your ngrok account that will store the full request and response parameters, headers, and bodies for each traffic event that flows through your endpoints.
This can be enabled by account admins by visiting the Observability section in the [ngrok Settings Page](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/settings) after logging in.

:::warning

Storing the full request and response data may mean you and your team members have access to sensitive data flowing through your endpoints.

:::

Once full capture mode is enabled, ngrok will begin capturing and storing the full requests and responses up to a maximum of 10KB, after which the data will be truncated. Header values will be truncated after 1KB for each value.
Data that is truncated will be indicated in the Traffic Inspector through the number of bytes that were captured as well as the number of headers.

This data is stored for your retention period of your account, currently set at 3 days from the time a request is received.

## Replay (Coming Soon)

Replay of requests allows the user to re-send a request to their backend without accessing the endpoint.

## Replay with Changes (Coming Soon)

ngrok Traffic Inspector allows you to edit the request before re-sending it to your backend.
