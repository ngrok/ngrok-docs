# Event Source Reference

## Event Sources

#### Traffic Events

When network traffic transits through your endpoints, like HTTP requests or TCP
connections, ngrok emits protocol-specific Traffic Events. Because Traffic Events are
often high cardinality, they support the ability to select which fields to capture as
well as the ability to specify a [CEL filter expression](/obs/#filters) to
limit which events are captured.

| Event                                                  | Description                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| [`http_request_complete.v0`](#http_request_completev0) | Triggers when an HTTP request completes.              |
| [`tcp_connection_closed.v0`](#tcp_connection_closedv0) | Triggers when a TCP connection to an endpoint closes. |

#### Audit Events

When you make configuration changes to your account ngrok emits Audit Events. These events
can help you get visibility into when objects like Domains, API Keys, and IP Policies are
created, updated, or deleted within your ngrok account.

| `acl`         | List&lt;string&gt; | optional list of ACL rules. If unspecified, the credential will have no restrictions. The only allowed ACL rule at this time is the `bind` rule. The `bind` rule allows the caller to restrict what domains and addresses the token is allowed to bind. For example, to allow the token to open a tunnel on example.ngrok.io your ACL would include the rule `bind:example.ngrok.io`.`Bind rules may specify a leading wildcard to match multiple domains with a common suffix. For example, you may specify a rule of`bind:_.example.com`which will allow`x.example.com`,` `y.example.com`,` `_.example.com`,`etc. A rule of`'\*'` is equivalent to no acl at all and will explicitly permit all actions. |

| `extensions`                   | Map&lt;string, string&gt; | A map of extensions included in the certificate. Extensions are additional metadata that can be interpreted by the SSH server for any purpose. These can be used to permit or deny the ability to open a terminal, do port forwarding, x11 forwarding, and more. If unspecified, the certificate will include limited permissions with the following extension map: `{"permit-pty":` "", "permit-user-rc": ""}` OpenSSH understands a number of predefined extensions.

| `extensions`                   | Map&lt;string, string&gt; | A map of extensions included in the certificate. Extensions are additional metadata that can be interpreted by the SSH server for any purpose. These can be used to permit or deny the ability to open a terminal, do port forwarding, x11 forwarding, and more. If unspecified, the certificate will include limited permissions with the following extension map: `{"permit-pty":` "", "permit-user-rc": ""}` OpenSSH understands a number of predefined extensions.

| `extensions`                   | Map&lt;string, string&gt; | A map of extensions included in the certificate. Extensions are additional metadata that can be interpreted by the SSH server for any purpose. These can be used to permit or deny the ability to open a terminal, do port forwarding, x11 forwarding, and more. If unspecified, the certificate will include limited permissions with the following extension map: `{"permit-pty":` "", "permit-user-rc": ""}` OpenSSH understands a number of predefined extensions.

| `acl`         | List&lt;string&gt; | optional list of ACL rules. If unspecified, the credential will have no restrictions. The only allowed ACL rule at this time is the `bind` rule. The `bind` rule allows the caller to restrict what domains and addresses the token is allowed to bind. For example, to allow the token to open a tunnel on example.ngrok.io your ACL would include the rule `bind:example.ngrok.io`. Bind rules may specify a leading wildcard to match multiple domains with a common suffix. For example, you may specify a rule of `bind:_.example.com` which will allow `x.example.com`, `y.example.com`, `_.example.com`, etc. A rule of `'\*'` is equivalent to no acl at all and will explicitly permit all actions. |

| `acl`         | List&lt;string&gt; | optional list of ACL rules. If unspecified, the credential will have no restrictions. The only allowed ACL rule at this time is the `bind` rule. The `bind` rule allows the caller to restrict what domains and addresses the token is allowed to bind. For example, to allow the token to open a tunnel on example.ngrok.io your ACL would include the rule `bind:example.ngrok.io`. Bind rules may specify a leading wildcard to match multiple domains with a common suffix. For example, you may specify a rule of `bind:_.example.com` which will allow `x.example.com`, `y.example.com`, `_.example.com`, etc. A rule of `'\*'` is equivalent to no acl at all and will explicitly permit all actions. |

| `token`       | string             | the credential’s authtoken that can be used to authenticate an ngrok agent. **This value is only available one time, on the API response from credential creation, otherwise it is null.**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `acl`         | List&lt;string&gt; | optional list of ACL rules. If unspecified, the credential will have no restrictions. The only allowed ACL rule at this time is the `bind` rule. The `bind` rule allows the caller to restrict what domains and addresses the token is allowed to bind. For example, to allow the token to open a tunnel on example.ngrok.io your ACL would include the rule `bind:example.ngrok.io`. Bind rules may specify a leading wildcard to match multiple domains with a common suffix. For example, you may specify a rule of `bind:_.example.com` which will allow `x.example.com`, `y.example.com`, `_.example.com`, etc. A rule of `'\*'` is equivalent to no acl at all and will explicitly permit all actions. |
