# ngrok Dashboard
--------------

The [ngrok Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com) allows you to quickly make changes to your ngrok account from any web browser. You can use it to view your active ngrok agent sessions, restart or disconnect ngrok agents remotely, customize your ngrok Cloud Edges, reserve Domains and TCP Addresses, generate authtoken credentials, and much more.

The ngrok dashboard allows many users to be invited to the same account. Each user in the account will have the same account type and be able to start tunnels under that account. The dashboard includes role based access control (RBAC) as a way to limit what users have access to in the account. You can manage these roles and add more users to your account in the [team members page](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/team/members) of the dashboard. This is only available for paid plans.

The ngrok dashboard is also where you manage your [account plans and billing credentials](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/billing). You may add additional users to be notified for any billing emails in the account. These emails do not count against your total user count.

As an additional security measure, you may restrict access to the ngrok dashboard by IP address range as well from the [IP Restrictions](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/security/ip-restrictions) page. If you accidentally lock yourself out of the dashboard, please contact [support@ngrok.com](mailto:support@ngrok.com?subject=Locked%20Out%20of%20Dashboard%20due%20to%20IP%20Restriction).
