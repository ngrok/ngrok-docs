# ngrok API
--------------

The ngrok API is the way to programmatically perform almost any action in the ngrok platform and access all of ngrok's resources. To access the ngrok API, you will need to generate an [API key from the ngrok Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/api).

The full reference documentation is available in our [ngrok API Documentation page](/api).

An easy way to explore the ngrok API is by using the ngrok agent, which has a [build in command line tool for accessing the API](/ngrok-agent/ngrok#ngrok-api).
