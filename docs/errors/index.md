# Errors

## Philosophy

When you encounter an error while using ngrok, we report a globally unique
error code. Each error code corresponds to a specific location in ngrok's code
which helps us quickly identify where something went wrong and help you know
exactly how to fix it.

When your report a bug or email us about a support issue, please include the
unique error code if you have encountered one. It will help us diagnose and
solve your issue much more quickly.

ngrok's error codes were also designed so that you can paste them into your
favorite search engine and immediately find a dedicated page with instructions
on how to fix your problem.

## Programmatic Error Handling

When working with ngrok's programmatically, we return these unique error codes
in a structured way so that you can write software which appropriately handles
different error conditions.
