### Additional Information

As a company based in the United States of America, we are no longer allowed to do business with entities that the United States government has imposed sanctions against.

As such, we can no longer offer services to individuals based in those sanctioned countries. You can read more about these requirements on the [United States Treasury website](https://ofac.treasury.gov/sanctions-programs-and-country-information).

We also block agent connections from known TOR exit nodes and other anonymizing proxies due to the fact that using such services to hide your identity is against our [Terms of Service](https://ngrok.com/tos).

If you are getting this error message, you will not be able to connect an ngrok Agent from the stated IP address. ngrok cannot add exceptions for these IP addresses.
