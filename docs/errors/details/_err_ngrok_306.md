### Possible Solutions

- You can upgrade to a paid plan in [the Billing section of the dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/billing). You will need at least a Personal plan or any pay-as-you-go-plan.
  - You can follow this guide to [register and use a custom domain](/guides/other-guides/how-to-set-up-a-custom-domain/).
- If you haven't already, add [your authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) from your account dashboard to your ngrok agent in your terminal using `ngrok config add-authtoken TOKEN`.
