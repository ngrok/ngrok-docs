### Additional Information

Using a custom domain such as app.example.com requires a paid ngrok plan. You can upgrade to a paid plan under the [Billing](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/billing) section in the ngrok Dashboard. Once you upgrade, you will be able to [register and use a custom domain](/docs/guides/how-to-set-up-a-custom-domain/) immediately.

### Possible Solutions

Upgrade to a paid plan in the ngrok Dashboard under the [Billing](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/billing) section. You will need a Personal, Pro or Enterprise plan to use a custom hostname.

If you haven't already, add [your authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) from your account dashboard to your ngrok agent in your terminal using `ngrok config add-authtoken TOKEN`.
