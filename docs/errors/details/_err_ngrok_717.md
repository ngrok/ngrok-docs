### Additional Information

ngrok can be used without a registered account for limited use cases but is only allowed a small number of connections at once. If you need additional connections, you will need to [register for a free ngrok account](https://dashboard.ngrok.com).

### Possible Solutions

1. If you do not have an ngrok account, please [register for one](https://dashboard.ngrok.com) and install the authtoken for your agent using the command `ngrok config add-authtoken <TOKEN>`.
2. If you have an ngrok account, ensure your authtoken is installed correctly using the command `ngrok config add-authtoken <TOKEN>`
