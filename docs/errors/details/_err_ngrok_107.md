### Additional Information

The authtoken in your configuration file is no longer valid. You can learn more about the location of the ngrok.yml configuration file [here](https://ngrok.com/docs#config-location).

You may have been removed from a team where you were formerly a member or your credential was explicitly revoked. In this case, your authtoken will no longer be valid to access the team account.

### Possible Solutions

- Your authtoken may have been reset. Please check to make sure your authtoken at [https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) matches the one that appears in your ngrok.yml configuration file.
- Please contact your former team's account owner if you think you have been removed from the team in error or if you believe your credential should still be active.
- You are using the tunnel credentials api and your authtoken has been deleted, or is malformed. Please [provision a new one](/api/resources/credentials/#create-tunnel-credential).
