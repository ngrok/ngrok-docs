### Additional Information

We encountered an issue when trying to process your card. We accept most major payment cards, but do not accept payment via PayPal, Venmo or any form of cryptocurrency at this time.

We also return this error when your card provider or bank declines your payment.

### Possible Solutions

Please make sure you are using a credit card and that you have entered all the information correctly. If you are using a pre-paid card, please ensure your payment card account balance is enough to cover the cost of your purchase.

If you are repeatedly seeing this error, your bank or card provider may be able to provide additional information. While there's often not much we can do, you can email us with a request for further investigation.
