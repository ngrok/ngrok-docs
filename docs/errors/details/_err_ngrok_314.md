### Additional Information

Custom hostnames such as something.com can only be reserved with a Pro or Business level plan. See our pricing page for more information [pricing](https://ngrok.com/pricing).

### Possible Solutions

Upgrade your account to a Pro or Business plan from your [account dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/billing/plan) in order to reserve a custom hostname.

If you don't need a fully-custom hostname, consider reserving a custom subdomain on one of our ngrok domains, such as something.ngrok.dev, which is available on our paid plans.
