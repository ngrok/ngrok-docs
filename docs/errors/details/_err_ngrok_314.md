### Possible Solutions

- Upgrade your account to a Pro or Pay-as-you-go plan from your [account dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/billing/plan) in order to reserve a custom hostname.

:::tip
If you don't need a fully-custom hostname, you can reserve a custom ngrok subdomain (like `example.ngrok.dev`) on our paid plans.
