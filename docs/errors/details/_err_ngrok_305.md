### Additional Information

Binding a custom subdomain on an ngrok domain requires a paid plan. Once you sign up for a paid plan, we'll give you an authtoken that you'll add to your ngrok agent. This will allow you to use custom subdomains.

### Possible Solutions

- [Sign up for a paid plan](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup). You'll need at least a Personal plan or any pay-as-you-go plan.

Add the authtoken from your account dashboard to your ngrok agent in your terminal.
