### Additional Info

- ngrok limits the number of inbound connections to your tunnels.
- Limits are imposed on connections, not requests. If your HTTP clients use persistent connections aka HTTP keep-alive (most modern ones do), you'll likely never hit this limit.
- ngrok will return a `429` response to HTTP connections that exceed the rate limit.
- Connections to TCP and TLS tunnels violating the rate limit will be closed without a response.

### Possible Solutions

- Upgrade your account to a Pro or Pay-as-you-go plan from your [account dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/billing/plan) in order to reserve a custom hostname.
