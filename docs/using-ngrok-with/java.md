# Using ngrok with Java
------------

If you'd like to programmatically manage your ngrok account and resources (register domains, create edges, configure IP restrictions, etc.), you can use the native [ngrok Java API Client](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-api-java) in your project.

If you're looking to programmatically start tunnels with the ngrok agent, check out Alex's [java-ngrok](https://github.com/alexdlaird/java-ngrok) library.
