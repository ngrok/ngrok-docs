# Using ngrok with Java

### API Client

If you'd like to programmatically manage your ngrok account and resources (register domains, create edges, configure IP restrictions, etc.), you can use the native [ngrok Java API Client](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-api-java) in your project.

### Agent Management

If you're looking to programmatically start tunnels with the ngrok agent, check out Alex's [java-ngrok](https://github.com/alexdlaird/java-ngrok) library.

### Java SDK (alpha)

Embed ngrok secure ingress into your Java apps with a single line of code with our alpha [ngrok Java SDK](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-java).
