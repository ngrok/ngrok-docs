# Using ngrok with Rust

## Agent SDK

We publish the ngrok-rust [Agent SDK](/agent-sdks/) which is an idiomatic Rust
crate to embed ngrok's secure ingress directly into your Rust applications. If
you’ve used the ngrok agent before, you can think of ngrok-rust as the agent
packaged as a Rust crate.
