# IP Restrictions

ngrok offers the ability to restrict access to your edges by IP address via [IP Restrictions](/docs/http/ip-restrictions/).
These are configurable via the [IPPolicy](/docs/k8s/user-guide/crds.md#ip-policies) CRD and can be attached to Ingress objects via [NgrokModuleSet](/docs/k8s/user-guide/route-modules.md).
