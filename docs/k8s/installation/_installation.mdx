## What you'll need

- A K8s cluster with kubectl access - We recommend using a recent version of K8s and will specify and test past versions as a part of [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/issues/154)
- [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) - 3.0.0 or later.

**Need a quick cluster for testing/development? Check out the [local cluster guide](/k8s/guides/local-cluster) first!**

## Add the ngrok Helm chart

```bash
helm repo add ngrok https://charts.ngrok.com
helm repo update
```

:::note
Whenever you want to update the operator or install a new version, you must run `helm repo update` to fetch the latest charts.

## Get your ngrok API key and authtoken

In order to use the ngrok Kubernetes Operator, you will need an ngrok account.
Once you have an account, you will need to log into the [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com) to gather the necessary credentials.

You will need two things from the dashboard:

- Your auth token, which can be found [here](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken)
- An API key, which can be generated [here](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/api)

These credentials will be created as a Kubernetes secret, which the controller will have access to.
The auth token is used to create tunnels, and the API key is used to manage resources via the ngrok API.

```bash
export NGROK_AUTHTOKEN=your copied auth token goes here
export NGROK_API_KEY=your copied api key goes here
```

## Select your namespace

Set the following variable to whatever you would like the installation namespace to be.
We recommend using the default `ngrok-operator` namespace unless you need to change that.

```bash
export NAMESPACE=ngrok-operator
```

## Install Gateway API CRDs (optional)

If you plan on using the Gateway API CRDs with the ngrok Kubernetes operator, install them before the operator.
When the operator starts up it will enable support for Gateway API if the Gateway API CRDs are detected in your cluster.
If you do not plan on using the Gateway API, then you can ignore this optional step.
The Gateway API CRDs can be installed at a later point, but you will need to restart the operator after installing the Gateway API CRDs
for the Gateway API support to be enabled.

You can select either the standard or experimental set of Gateway API CRDs depending on your preference. Either version will work with the ngrok Kubernetes operator.

https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/

After installing the Gateway API CRDs, create the following `GatewayClass` so that you can mark which Gateway API resources that the ngrok operator should handle

```bash
kubectl apply -f -<<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: GatewayClass
metadata:
	name: ngrok
spec:
	controllerName: ngrok.com/gateway-controller
EOF
```

## Install the Operator

While you can pass the credential values directly via helm values like the below simple example shows, we do not recommend this for production scenarios.
Instead, we recommend creating a Kubernetes secret and passing the secret name to the helm chart.
This allows for easier infrastructure as code and prevents users with access to the cluster from viewing the API key and auth token using commands like `helm get values`.
Select one of the below options based on which method you are comfortable with.

<Tabs groupId="k8s" queryString="k8s-install">
	<TabItem value="simple" label="Simple Method" default>
		```bash
		helm install ngrok-operator ngrok/ngrok-operator \
		--namespace $NAMESPACE \
		--create-namespace \
		--set credentials.apiKey=$NGROK_API_KEY \
		--set credentials.authtoken=$NGROK_AUTHTOKEN
		```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="secure" label="More Secure Method">
		First, prepare the Secret for your credentials

		```bash
		export ENCODED_NGROK_AUTHTOKEN=$(echo -n "$NGROK_AUTHTOKEN" | base64)
		export ENCODED_NGROK_API_KEY=$(echo -n "$NGROK_API_KEY" | base64)
		kubectl apply -f -<<EOF
		apiVersion: v1
		kind: Secret
		metadata:
			name: ngrok-operator-credentials
			namespace: $NAMESPACE
		data:
			API_KEY: "$ENCODED_NGROK_API_KEY"
			AUTHTOKEN: "$ENCODED_NGROK_AUTHTOKEN"
		EOF
		```

		Next, install the operator

		```bash
		helm install ngrok-operator ngrok/ngrok-operator \
		--namespace $NAMESPACE \
		--create-namespace \
		--set credentials.secret.name=ngrok-operator-credentials \
		```
		</TabItem>
