import RemoteYamlBlock from "@site/src/components/RemoteYamlBlock";


The following YAML block contains the default `values.yaml` used when installing the ngrok Kubernetes Operator. You can reference these values and change them individually with `--set` flags while installing/upgrading the ngrok Kubernetes operator.

You can also see these values in [the ngrok operator repo](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/blob/main/helm/ngrok-operator/values.yaml).

## Common configurations

This section provides some common use cases and recommendations when using this helm chart in a production setting. 

### Deployment Scaling

By default, the replica count is set to 1 via `replicaCount` . We recommend overriding this to 2 or more to ensure high availability during roll-outs and failures, and to spread out the load.

### ngrok Region

ngrok runs globally distributed tunnel servers around the world to enable fast, low latency traffic to your applications. See [ngrok's points of presence](/universal-gateway/points-of-presence/) for more information on ngrok's regions.

Similar to the agent, if you do not explicitly pick a region via helm when installing the operator, the operator will attempt to pick the region with the least latency, which is usually the one geographically closest to your machine.

See the [helm value `region`](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/blob/main/helm/ngrok-operator/values.yaml#L47) to configure a specific region for the controller to use.

### Metrics

This operator exposes prometheus metrics on the `/metrics` endpoint. The metrics are exposed on the `:8080` port and can be scraped by prometheus or other services using typical means.

This project is built using kube-builder, so out of the box it exposes the metrics listed [here](https://book.kubebuilder.io/reference/metrics-reference.html?highlight=metrics#default-exported-metrics-references)

### Watching Specific Namespaces

By default, the Operator watches all namespaces. It's a common use case to need a controller to watch only a specific namespace in the case where you may run a controller in a namespace for each team or environment. In order to watch only a specific namespace for ingress objects, you can set the helm value `watchNamespace` to the namespace you want to watch.
