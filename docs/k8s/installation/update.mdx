Updating the ngrok Kubernetes operator is a very simple and straight-forward process.
Before updating, it is always best to check which version of the ngrok Kubernetes operator you are running
and comparing your current image version (not the helm chart version) to the most recent version or the version you
want to update to. You can refer to the [operator changelog](/k8s/changelog) to view what has changed since the
version you are running to be informed about the changes you are making by updating.

## 1. (optional) Update Gateway API CRDs

If you're using the Gateway API CRDs, you might want to update them while updating the operator.
For the most up-to-date information about installing/updating these, it is best to refer directly to the
Gateway API website.

https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/

## 2. Update your helm repo

Fetch all the latest updates for your helm repositories to pull down all of the latest ngrok Kubernetes operator chart versions.

```bash
helm repo update
```

## 3. (optional) Find a Specific Release

The following command will print out a list of all the available versions of the ngrok Kubernetes operator chart including development releases.
If you want to update to a specific release of the operator instead of updating to the latest version, you can set the following variable to the
version of the helm chart (not the `APP VERSION`) you would like to install.

This step is necessary if you plan on upgrading to a development version as helm will never install these versions for you unless you explicitly
specify that you want to install a development version. Development versions are considered any version that does not follow the format `<major version>.<minor version>.<patch version>` such as `0.17.0-rc.1`.
Many of the development versions of the ngrok Kubernetes operator follow that format with `rc` standing for Release Candidate. These are early development builds before an official release
and may contain features that have not been fully implemented or bugs that have not been identified through testing.

```bash
helm search repo ngrok/ngrok-operator --versions --devel
```

```bash
export OPERATOR_CHART_VERSION=0.17.0
```

## 4. Update the Operator with Helm

Set the following variables to the name and namespace of your operator installation.
You can check this with `helm list -A` if you did not use the following defaults.

```bash
export OPERATOR_NAME=ngrok-operator
export OPERATOR_NAMESPACE=ngrok-operator
```

<Tabs groupId="k8s" queryString="version">
	<TabItem value="latest" label="Latest Release" default>
	```bash
	helm upgrade $OPERATOR_NAME ngrok/ngrok-operator \
	--reuse-values
	```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="specific" label="Specific Release">
	```bash
	helm upgrade $OPERATOR_NAME ngrok/ngrok-operator \
	--version $OPERATOR_CHART_VERSION \
	--reuse-values
	```
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>


:::note
The --reuse-values flag will tell Helm to reuse any values you used in your last install/upgrade. You can change them or add new values by chaining --set flags just like when installing the operator.
