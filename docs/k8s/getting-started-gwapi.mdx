# Kubernetes Ingress Controller

## Overview

The Kubernetes Operator allows access to k8s Services using the new [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/).
This implementation includes CRDS for a Gateway as well as HTTPRoute.
Additional routes, such as TLSRoute and TCPRoute will be added at a later date when they move from experimental to stable.

## Install

Installing the ngrok Operator is easy using Helm.

## Create an edge with a domain

This would create an Edge on with the Domain `example.ngrok.app` that routes traffic to the Kubernetes service `example-service` running on port 80.

## Route Traffic based on a path

This would create an Edge on with the Domain `example.ngrok.app` that routes traffic from example.ngrok.app/foo to the Kubernetes service `example-service` running on port 80.

## Modify Headers

This would modify the headers

## Redirect Traffic

This would redirect a request to another URL

## Pricing

The ngrok Kubernetes Gateway API is available to all ngrok users at no
additional charge. You only incur costs if the resources provisioned by the
controller incur a cost.
