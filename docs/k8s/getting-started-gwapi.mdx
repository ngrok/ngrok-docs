# Kubernetes Gateway API

## Overview

The ngrok Kubernetes Operator allows access to Kubernetes Services using the new [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/).
This implementation includes CRDs for a Gateway as well as `HTTPRoute`.
Additional routes, such as `TLSRoute` and `TCPRoute` will be added at a later date when they move from experimental to stable.

## Install

Installing the ngrok Kubernetes Operator is easy using Helm.

## Create An Edge With A Domain

This would create an Edge with the Domain `example.ngrok.app` that routes traffic to the Kubernetes service `example-service` running on port `80`.

## Route Traffic Based On A Path

This would create an Edge with the Domain `example.ngrok.app` that routes traffic from `example.ngrok.app/foo` to the Kubernetes service `example-service` running on port `80`.

## Modify Headers

This would modify request headers by removing the `x-request-id` header, adding an additional one and setting another header to a specific value.

## Redirect Traffic

This would redirect a request from `"example.ngrok.app"` to `"example.ngrok.app/paprika"`

## Pricing

The ngrok Kubernetes Operator is available to all ngrok users at no
additional charge. You only incur costs if the resources provisioned by your usage of the ngrok Kubernetes Operator, such as endpoints or traffic policies, incur a cost. More information can be found on the [pricing page](https://ngrok.com/pricing)
