# Kubernetes Ingress Controller

## Overview

The Kubernetes Ingress Controller within the Kubernetes Operator allows access to Kubernetes Services using Kubernetes [Ingress CRDs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/). More details on how these are derived is described in the [guide to edges in k8s](/docs/k8s/with-edges).

Other ngrok features such as TCP Edges can be configured via [CRDs](/docs/k8s/crds).

If you are looking to install the controller for the first time, see our [deployment-guide](/docs/k8s/deployment-guide/).
If it's already installed and you are looking to configure ingress for an app or service, see our [user-guide](/docs/k8s/user-guide/).

## Install

Installing the ngrok Operator is easy using Helm.

<K8sIngressInstallExample />

## Create an edge with a domain

This would create an Edge on with the Domain `example.ngrok.app` that routes traffic to the Kubernetes service `example-service` running on port 80.

## Route Traffic based on a path

This would create an Edge on with the Domain `example.ngrok.app` that routes traffic from `example.ngrok.app/foo` to the Kubernetes service `example-service` running on port 80.

## Modify Headers

This would modify the headers to add headers for `is-ngrok` (set to a value of "1") and a `country` (based on the country code). It would also remove the `referrer` header.

## Pricing

The ngrok Kubernetes Ingress Controller is available to all ngrok users at no
additional charge. You only incur costs if the resources provisioned by the
controller incur a cost. More details can be found on our [pricing page](https://ngrok.com/pricing).
