# Kubernetes Operator

## Overview

The ngrok Kubernetes Operator is the best way to use ngrok if your
applications run in Kubernetes environments. It supports both [Ingress CRDs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) as well as the new [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/).

The ngrok Kubernetes Operator is deployed to a cluster and allows developers to self-service public endpoints to their apps and services using a shared ngrok account.

## When Should I Use The Kubernetes Operator?

The Kubernetes Operator is a great tool to use when you want to use ngrok to connect to services running on a Kubernetes Cluster. If you are running Kubernetes and do not want to use the ngrok SDKs, we recommend using the Operator

## Should I Use The Ingress Controller Or The Gateway API?

The Operator supports both Kubernetes Ingress and the Gateway API. These two different solutions have differences and similarities, you can read the [Kubernetes Ingress docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) and the [Gateway API docs](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/). However, there are no major functional differences between the ingress controller and Gateway API in the ngrok Kubernetes Operator.

## Pricing

The ngrok Kubernetes Operator is available to all ngrok users at no
additional charge. You only incur costs if the resources provisioned by the
operator incur a cost.
