# Kubernetes Operator

The ngrok Kubernetes Operator is the best way to use ngrok if your applications run in Kubernetes environments.
It comes with custom resources for configuration and also supports both `Ingress` resources as well as the new cross-platform [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) configuration resources.
When using Kubernetes Ingresses or the Gateway API resources, the ngrok Kubernetes Operator will translate them into managed instances of the ngrok custom resources for you.

The ngrok Kubernetes Operator is deployed to a cluster and allows developers to self-service endpoints to their apps and services using a shared ngrok account.

## When Should I Use The ngrok Kubernetes Operator?

The ngrok Kubernetes Operator is a great tool to use when you want to use ngrok to connect to services running on a Kubernetes Cluster. If you are running Kubernetes and do not want to use the ngrok SDKs, we recommend using the ngrok Kubernetes Operator.
The operator makes it easy to get traffic to your Kubernetes workloads and also enables you to easily perform cross-cluster networking as well as integrating Kubernetes workloads with workloads outside of Kubernetes such as those running on
virtual machines, bare metal, embedded devices, and anywhere else you can run ngrok.

## What Type of Config Should I Use With The Operator?

The Operator supports its own native custom resource types, Kubernetes Ingresses, and the Gateway API.
These options have differences and similarities, you can read the [Kubernetes Ingress docs][] and the [Gateway API docs][] for more information about these configuration options.
Kubernetes Ingresses are easy to get started with for more simple use-cases while Gateway API offers more configuration options for traffic management and transformations.
The ngrok custom resources can be used directly for complete control over your traffic and for many features not natively supported by Ingresses or the Gateway API such as configuring
OAuth/OIDC, rate limiting, and more.

There is no requirement that you stick to only a single type of configuration. For example, you may have one domain with a simple use-case that you configure using Kubernetes Ingresses, and other
domain with more complex requirements that uses Gateway API or ngrok custom resources for configuration.

## Pricing

The ngrok Kubernetes Operator is available to all ngrok users at no
additional charge. You only incur costs if the resources provisioned by the
controller incur a cost. More details can be found on our [pricing page](https://ngrok.com/pricing).
