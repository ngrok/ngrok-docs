# Kubernetes Operator

## Overview

The ngrok Kubernetes Operator is the best way to use ngrok if your
applications run in Kubernetes environments. It supports both [Ingress CRDs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) as well as the new [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/).

The ngrok Kubernetes Operator is deployed to a cluster and allows developers to self-service public endpoints to their apps and services using a shared ngrok account.

The operator watches for Kubernetes objects and creates the corresponding ngrok endpoints and configurations.

More details on how these are derived can be found [here](./user-guide/ingress-to-edge-relationship).

Other ngrok features such as TCP Edges can be configured via [CRDs](./user-guide/crds).

If you are looking to install the controller for the first time, see our [deployment-guide](./deployment-guide/README).
If it's already installed and you are looking to configure ingress for an app or service, see our [user-guide](./user-guide/README).

## Install

Installing the ngrok Operator is easy using Helm.

<Tabs groupId="k8s-install" queryString="k8s-install">
	<TabItem value="ingress" label="Ingress Controller">
		<K8sIngressInstallExample />
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="gatewayAPI" label="Gateway API" default>
		<K8sGatewayAPIInstallExample />
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Example Usage

This would create an Edge on with the Domain `example.ngrok.app` that routes traffic to the Kubernetes service `example-service` running on port 80.

<Tabs groupId="k8s-basic" queryString="k8s-basic">
	<TabItem value="ingress" label="Ingress Controller">
		<StaticDomainKubernetesExample />
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="gatewayAPI" label="Gateway API" default>
		<StaticDomainKubernetesGatewayExample />
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Pricing

The ngrok Kubernetes Ingress Controller is available to all ngrok users at no
additional charge. You only incur costs if the resources provisioned by the
controller incur a cost.
