The ngrok Kubernetes Operator enables you to use ngrok to connect to services running on a Kubernetes Cluster. When deployed to a cluster, it allows developers to self-service endpoints to their apps and services using a shared ngrok account.

You should use the ngrok Kubernetes Operator if you want to:

1. Send traffic to your Kubernetes workloads
1. Integrate Kubernetes workloads with workloads outside of Kubernetes, such as those running on virtual machines, bare metal, embedded devices, and anywhere else you can run ngrok
1. Perform cross-cluster networking
1. Use Kubernetes with ngrok without using ngrok's SDKs

## Choosing a configuration type

The Operator supports its own native custom resource types, including:

- [Kubernetes Ingresses](/docs/k8s/guides/using-ingresses/)
  - Easy to get started with for more simple use-cases
- [Gateway API](/docs/k8s/guides/using-gwapi/)
  - Offers more configuration options for traffic management and transformations
- [ngrok's Managed resources](/docs/k8s/guides/managed-resources/)
  - Offers complete control over your traffic, enabling many features such as OAuth/OIDC, rate limiting, and more

:::tip
You can use a different configuration type for each domain.

## Pricing

The ngrok Kubernetes Operator is available to all ngrok users at no
additional charge. You only incur costs if the resources provisioned by the
controller incur a cost. More details can be found on our [pricing page](https://ngrok.com/pricing).
