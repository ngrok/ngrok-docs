# ngrok Kubernetes Operator to Edge Relationship

This ngrok Kubernetes Operator automatically creates and manages ngrok Edges based on the Kubernetes objects you create. An [ngrok Edge](/docs/network-edge/) holds the traffic policy and routing information for your endpoints. Below, we explain how multiple kubernetes objects with rules and hosts that overlap combine to form Edges in the ngrok service.

In Short:

- A host correlates directly to an ngrok Edge
- Rules spread across kubernetes objects with matching hosts get merged into the same ngrok Edge
- Annotations on a Kubernetes object apply only to the routes in the rules in that object if possible

## Ingress Controller

The Ingress Controller within the ngrok Operator uses Kubernetes Ingress to connect your Kubernetes cluster and the ngrok service.

### Types of Ingress

[This Kubernetes "Types of Ingress" Doc](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#types-of-ingress) breaks down a few common ingress examples. We'll use these examples to explain how the ingress controller will handle them and what the end result edge configurations are.

#### Single Service Ingress

There are existing Kubernetes concepts that allow you to expose a single Service. You can also do this with an Ingress by specifying a default backend with no rules.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: test-ingress
spec:
  defaultBackend:
    service:
      name: test
      port:
        number: 80
```

While not implemented yet, when completed, this style of ingress should allow exposing a service across all edges configured by the controller. Without any other ingress objects with hosts configured though, this ingress would do nothing as there is no edge and host to attach to.

#### Simple Fanout

A fanout configuration routes traffic from a single IP address to more than one Service, based on the HTTP URI being requested. An Ingress allows you to keep the number of load balancers down to a minimum.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: simple-fanout-example
spec:
  rules:
    - host: foo.bar.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /foo
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: service1
                port:
                  number: 4200
          - path: /bar
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: service2
                port:
                  number: 8080
```

This configuration would produce a single edge with two routes.

- edge: `foo.bar.com`
  - route: `/foo` -> `service1:4200`
  - route: `/bar` -> `service2:8080`

If another ingress object like this was created

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: simple-fanout-example-2
spec:
  rules:
    - host: foo.bar.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /baz
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: service3
                port:
                  number: 8080
```

The edge would be updated to have three routes.

- edge: `foo.bar.com`
  - route: `/foo` -> `service1:4200`
  - route: `/bar` -> `service2:8080`
  - route: `/baz` -> `service3:8080`

Ingress rules with the same host are merged into the same edge.

#### Name-based Virtual Hosting

Name-based virtual hosting is a common way to implement virtual hosting on a single IP address. Each host name is associated with a distinct IP address, and the DNS resolver associates a given host name with its corresponding IP address(es). The Ingress resource does not require any special support for name-based virtual hosting, but it does require that the DNS resolver be configured to return the correct IP address for a given host name.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: name-virtual-host-ingress
spec:
  rules:
    - host: foo.bar.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: service1
                port:
                  number: 80
    - host: bar.foo.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: service2
                port:
                  number: 80
```

This configuration would produce two edges with one route each.

- edge: `foo.bar.com`
  - route: `/` -> `service1:80`
- edge: `bar.foo.com`
  - route: `/` -> `service2:80`

#### No Host

The kubernetes spec specifies:

If you create an Ingress resource without any hosts defined in the rules, then any web traffic to the IP address of your Ingress controller can be matched without a name based virtual host being required.

This only can be applied to ingress controllers that create static IPs to route to. With ngrok, an Edge always has a hostname, otherwise it's not route-able. If a rule with no host is created, it will be dropped.

### Annotations

The current annotations are being moved to a new Module CRD now. These docs will be updated when it's finished. The approach and structure will be the same, just showing how modules apply to routes.

Annotations are created and applied at the ingress object level. However, from the section above, multiple ingresses can combine and be shared to form multiple edges. When using annotations that apply specifically to routes, the annotations on the ingress apply to all routes, but routes for multiple edges across different ingresses don't have to have the same annotations or modules.

So while annotations are limited to being applied to the whole ingress object, and we'd like to apply different route module annotations to different routes in 1 edge, we can leverage the fact that multiple ingresses can be combined to form an edge if the rules hosts match, but each annotation only applies to those routes in the ingress object they came from.

```yaml
apiVersion: ingress.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
kind: NgrokModuleSet
metadata:
  name: example-module-set-1
modules:
  headers:
    add:
      X-SEND-TO-CLIENT: Value1
---
apiVersion: ingress.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
kind: NgrokModuleSet
metadata:
  name: example-module-set-2
modules:
  headers:
    add:
      X-SEND-TO-CLIENT: Value2
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example-header-add-1
  annotations:
    k8s.ngrok.com/modules: "example-module-set-1"
spec:
  rules:
    - host: foo.bar.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /foo
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: service1
                port:
                  number: 4200
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example-header-add-2
  annotations:
    k8s.ngrok.com/modules: "example-module-set-2"
spec:
  rules:
    - host: foo.bar.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /bar
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: service2
                port:
                  number: 8080
```

This configuration would produce a single edge with two routes. Each route has a different http response header module

- edge: `foo.bar.com`
  - route: `/foo` -> `service1:4200`
    - module: `response-headers-add` -> `{"X-SEND-TO-CLIENT": "Value1"}`
  - route: `/bar` -> `service2:8080`
    - module: `response-headers-add` -> `{"X-SEND-TO-CLIENT": "Value2"}`

### Collisions and Errors

Because the controller combines multiple ingress objects into a combined model that represents a set of edges, it is possible to have configurations collide and overwrite each other. When possible, the controller aims to drop the minimal amount of configuration rather than erroring to keep the majority of the edges and routes up and running when there is a configuration error. The controller will then emit logs and events warning of the bad configuration.

#### Rule Paths

If multiple ingress objects have rules with the same host and path, the controller will drop whichever one it sees first because it will merge over the route path on that edge. Only 1 host and path combination can exist on an edge.

#### NgrokModuleSets

The [NgrokModuleSet CRD](/docs/k8s/crds#ngrok-module-sets) is a collection of route module configurations. When set on an ingress object, it applies to all routes on that ingress object, but not routes on other ingress objects that may be combined to form the same edge.
You can set multiple module sets on an ingress object. The controller will merge the modules from all of the module sets together. If there are any collisions, the controller will drop the module from the first set.

## Gateway API

The Kubernetes Gateway API is a new solution by the Network SIG to solve some of the challenges with Kubernetes Ingress. Some of the notable challenges were:

- Setting up Kubernetes Ingress requires significant access: the Gateway API implementation separates the objects needed based upon role (Gateways for Cluster Operators and Routes for Application Developers)
- Kubernetes Ingress is simple, making annotations the only way to add things like policies or modules: The Route objects have the capability to add additional rules to direct and modify traffic.

### Route types

The Gateway API supports 5 route types: HTTPRoute, TLSRoute, TCPRoute, UDPRoute, and GRPCRoute. Only HTTRoutes are stable, the others are in an experimental channel. ngrok supports edges for HTTP/S, TLS, and TCP. The ngrok Operator currently only supports the HTTPRoute. TLSRoute and TCPRoute will be added after they become stable.

### Rules

The ngrok Operator currently supports matches and multiple filters for HTTPRoute. Some of these filters align with modules/policies that are supported by ngrok. These are implemented using [ngrok traffic policy](/docs/http/traffic-policy/) and will generate a policy document that is uploaded to the ngrok service.

Additional ngrok Policy rules can be added by referencing a `NgrokTrafficPolicy` CRD using an `ExtensionRef` filter in the HTTPRoute, see the
[Traffic Policy Gateway Composition User Guide](/docs/k8s/user-guide/#gateway-composition) for more information.
