## How the ngrok Operator Uses LoadBalancer Services

By default, services of type `LoadBalancer` are exposed using a TCP Endpoint.
A reserved address is automatically created for the service and the service's status will be updated with the reserved address.
Other projects like [external-dns](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/blob/main/docs/examples/external-dns/README.md) can be used to create a CNAME record for the reserved address automatically.

See the [TCP Endpoint](/tcp/) and [TLS Endpoint](/tls/) pages for more information about how ngrok handles these kinds of endpoints.

For example, the following `LoadBalancer` service will be provided by a TCP Endpoint.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
	name: mysite
spec:
	allocateLoadBalancerNodePorts: false # ngrok's tunneling technology does not require NodePorts to be allocated.
	loadBalancerClass: ngrok
	type: LoadBalancer
	selector:
		app: mysite
	ports:
		- name: traffic
			port: 9000
			protocol: TCP
			targetPort: 9000
```

If you would instead like a TLS Endpoint, the following example showcases how you can create one.
The `k8s.ngrok.com/domain` annotation is required to use TLS and will expose the service as a TLS endpoint.
Once the reserved domain is ready and the endpoint is created, the service's status will be updated with the ngrok address.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
	name: mysite
	annotations:
		k8s.ngrok.com/domain: mysite.mydomain.com # Required to use TLS
		external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname: "mysite.mydomain.com"
spec:
	allocateLoadBalancerNodePorts: false # ngrok's tunneling technology does not require NodePorts to be allocated.
	loadBalancerClass: ngrok
	type: LoadBalancer
	selector:
		app: mysite
	ports:
		- name: traffic
			port: 9000
			protocol: TCP
			targetPort: 9000
```

While using Services offers simplicity, using the `CloudEndpoint` and `AgentEndpoint` resources directly instead of translating `LoadBalancer` services into them using the operator offers more configuration options and flexibility for configuring TCP and TLS endpoints.
