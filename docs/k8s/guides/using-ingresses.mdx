## How the ngrok Operator Uses Ingresses

The ngrok Kubernetes operator consumes `Ingress` resources and translates them into the native ngrok `CloudEndpoint` and `AgentEndpoint` custom resources.
Each hostname from the `Ingress` resources you configure will cause the operator to create a `CloudEndpoint` for the hostname.
Each unique upstream service you reference using `HTTPRoute` resources will cause the operator to create an `AgentEndpoint` with an `internal` binding so that it is not accessible directly on the internet.
The operator then generates ngrok [traffic policy](/traffic-policy/) configuration on those `CloudEndpoint` to perform all the routing and actions specified in your Gateway API configuration and route to the internal `AgentEndpoint` resources that handle forwarding traffic to your upstream services.
When you create/update/delete Gateway API resources, the operator will automatically handle creating/updating/deleting the `CloudEndpoint` and `AgentEndpoint` resources as needed.

## Fan-out vs Multiple

The operator supports using a single ingress for your hostname that includes several rules such as the below example.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
	name: example-ingress
	namespace: default
spec:
	ingressClassName: ngrok
	rules:
		- host: example-ingress.ngrok.io
			http:
				paths:
					- path: /foo
						pathType: Prefix
						backend:
							service:
								name: foo-service
								port:
									number: 80
					- path: /bar
						pathType: Prefix
						backend:
							service:
								name: bar-service
								port:
									number: 80
```

Or you can create multiple different `Ingress` resources that produce the same effect such as the example below.
The operator will translate both examples into the same configuration.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
	name: example-ingress-foo
	namespace: default
spec:
	ingressClassName: ngrok
	rules:
		- host: example-ingress.ngrok.io
			http:
				paths:
					- path: /foo
						pathType: Prefix
						backend:
							service:
								name: foo-service
								port:
									number: 80
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
	name: example-ingress-bar
	namespace: default
spec:
	ingressClassName: ngrok
	rules:
		- host: example-ingress.ngrok.io
			http:
				paths:
					- path: /bar
						pathType: Prefix
						backend:
							service:
								name: bar-service
								port:
									number: 80
```

## Using `NgrokTrafficPolicy` with `Ingress`

To extend the functionality of `Ingress` resources, you have the option of combining them with `NgrokTrafficPolicy` resources to take advantage of ngrok's [traffic policy](/traffic-policy/) system.

`NgrokTrafficPolicy` can be used with `Ingress` resources in three different ways:

- As an annotation
  - When supplied via an annotation, the rules from the `NgrokTrafficPolicy` run first when requests are sent to any endpoints created for the `Ingress` before any rules from traffic policies supplied as backends or the default backend.
  - If used in this way, the traffic policy may "terminate" the request by sending back a response or by forwarding to another endpoint using the `forward-internal` action, but if done so, then the request will not be further processed by any other rules in the `Ingress`.
  - This can allow you to enforce common actions such as header manipulation or authentication for any request matching the ingress regardless of which `Ingress` rule the request may match.
- As the backend for a specific rule
  - `NgrokTrafficPolicy` resources can be used in place of a `Service` for the backend of an Ingress rule.
  - When used this way, the rules from these traffic policies are executed after any traffic policy rules from an annotation `NgrokTrafficPolicy` (if supplied) and only if the request matches the `Ingress` rule.
    Since the `NgrokTrafficPolicy` is used in-place of a `Service` it is expected that the `NgrokTrafficPolicy` will "terminate" the request either by sending back the response on its own, or forwarding to another endpoint using the `forward-internal` action.
- As the default backend
  - You may use an `NgrokTrafficPolicy` as the default backend of your `Ingress`. The rules from the traffic policy will only be executed if the request does not match any of your other `Ingress` rules.
  - Since the `NgrokTrafficPolicy` is used in-place of a `Service` it is expected that the `NgrokTrafficPolicy` will "terminate" the request either by sending back the response on its own, or forwarding to another endpoint using the `forward-internal` action.

You can use one or multiple of the above options depending on your use-case and preferences.

The following example shows how you can supply an `NgrokTrafficPolicy` to an `Ingress` using an annotation.
It must be in the same namespace as the `Ingress`.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
	annotations:
		k8s.ngrok.com/traffic-policy: my-ngroktrafficpolicy
	name: example-ingress
	namespace: default
spec:
	ingressClassName: ngrok
	rules:
		- host: example-ingress.ngrok.io
			http:
				paths:
					- path: /
						pathType: Prefix
						backend:
							service:
								name: example-service
								port:
									number: 80
```

The following example shows how you can supply an `NgrokTrafficPolicy` to an `Ingress` as the backend for a specific rule.
It must be in the same namespace as the `Ingress`.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
	name: example-ingress
	namespace: default
spec:
	ingressClassName: ngrok
	rules:
		- host: example-ingress.ngrok.io
			http:
				paths:
					- path: /
						pathType: Prefix
						backend:
							resource:
								apiGroup: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com
								kind: NgrokTrafficPolicy
								name: my-ngroktrafficpolicy
```

The following example shows how you can supply an `NgrokTrafficPolicy` to an `Ingress` as the default backend.
It must be in the same namespace as the `Ingress`.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
	name: example-ingress
	namespace: default
spec:
	ingressClassName: ngrok
	defaultBackend:
		resource:
			apiGroup: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com
			kind: NgrokTrafficPolicy
			name: my-ngroktrafficpolicy
	rules:
		- host: example-ingress.ngrok.io
			http:
				paths:
					- path: /
						pathType: Prefix
						backend:
							service:
								name: example-service
								port:
									number: 80
```

## Ingress HTTPS Upstreams

If you have an Ingress that routes to a Service that expects HTTPS instead of HTTP, you can specify this using the `k8s.ngrok.com/app-protocols` annotation on your `Service`.
For example, the following `Service` uses the annotation to let the operator know which ports use HTTPS

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
	name: example-service
	labels:
		app: example-app
	annotations:
		k8s.ngrok.com/app-protocols: '{"https-port":"https","http-port":"http"}'
spec:
	ports:
		- name: https-port
			port: 443
			protocol: TCP
			targetPort: 8443
		- name: http-port
			port: 80
			protocol: TCP
			targetPort: 8080
	selector:
		app: example-app
```

## Ingress Conflicts

In order to support the ability for users to configure multiple `Ingress` resources that use the same hostname like in the example above, the operator enforces a requirement that all `Ingress` resources that use a given hostname must have the same configuration for the `k8s.ngrok.com/pooling-enabled` and `k8s.ngrok.com/traffic-policy` annotations.
This means that if you use an ingress such as the following example for `foo.ngrok.io`, any other `Ingress` using the `foo.ngrok.io` hostname **must** have the same pooling and traffic policy annotations as the one below.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
	annotations:
		k8s.ngrok.com/traffic-policy: my-ngroktrafficpolicy
		k8s.ngrok.com/pooling-enabled: "true"
	name: example-ingress
	namespace: default
spec:
	ingressClassName: ngrok
	rules:
		- host: example-ingress.ngrok.io
			http:
				paths:
					- path: /
						pathType: Prefix
						backend:
							service:
								name: example-service
								port:
									number: 80
```
