TCP routing allows an API Gateway to handle raw network traffic at the transport layer, enabling it to serve as an entry point for non-HTTP protocols such as databases, game servers, messaging brokers, or custom protocols.

Proper TCP routing makes it possible to:

üîÅ Consolidate entry points for multiple TCP-based services. <br /> 
üì° Expose internal services to the internet with controlled access. <br /> 
üîå Handle any binary or custom protocol without deep inspection. <br />

## üîç What are the Benefits of TCP Routing?

Unlike HTTP and TLS routing, TCP routing operates at Layer 4 of the OSI model. 
The API Gateway uses the destination port or IP to determine the target backend‚Äîideal for workloads that don't use HTTP.

With TCP routing, the gateway can route connections using:

- Port-based rules (e.g., port 5432 ‚Üí PostgreSQL service, port 4222 ‚Üí NATS server).
- Static or dynamic IP/port mappings to backend services.
- Connection-level metadata, such as source IP or client certificate, if applicable.

Key Benefits:

- Protocol Agnostic Routing: Support non-HTTP services or custom TCP protocols.
- High Performance: Route traffic with minimal latency and overhead.
- Secure Exposure of Internal Services: Control who can access backend services on the transport layer.

## TCP Routing Examples

The following examples showcase how you can route TCP traffic to your upstream services.

You must first create a [TCP Address](/docs/universal-gateway/tcp-addresses/). 
When you create a TCP address, a random hostname and port will be assigned to you, e.g. `1.tcp.ngrok.io:12345`.
See the [TCP Endpoints page](/docs/universal-gateway/tcp/) for more details on how ngrok handles TCP endpoints.

	```yaml
	apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
	kind: AgentEndpoint
	metadata:
		name: example-service
		namespace: default
	spec:
		url: tcp://1.tcp.ngrok.io:12345
		upstream:
			url: tcp://example-service.example-namespace:8443
	```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="endpoints" label="CloudEndpoint with AgentEndpoint">

	### 1. Create an `AgentEndpoint` for your upstream `Service`
	```yaml
	apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
	kind: AgentEndpoint
	metadata:
		name: example-service
		namespace: default
	spec:
		url: tcp://example-service.internal:8443
		upstream:
			url: tcp://example-service.example-namespace:8443
	```

	### 2. Create a `CloudEndpoint` that routes to the `AgentEndpoint`

	```yaml
	apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
	kind: CloudEndpoint
	metadata:
		name: example-cloud-endpoint
	spec:
		url: tcp://1.tcp.ngrok.io:12345
		trafficPolicy:
			policy:
				on_http_request:
				- actions:
					- type: forward-internal
						config:
							url: tcp://example-service.internal:8443
	```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="gateway-api" label="Gateway API">

	For TLS and TCP Routes, you must put the domain in the `Gateway.Spec.Addresses` field as the ngrok operator needs to know what domains to use when creating endpoints for you and Gateway API forbids using the hostname field
	on Gateway listeners for TCP/TLS protocols.

	Since the `Gateway.Spec.Addresses` are expected to bind to all listeners, you may want to create separate Gateways for TLS and TCP endpoints to prevent unwanted conflicts and overlap.
	For these reasons, TCP and TLS routing is often more easily configurable using the `AgentEndpoint` resources directly instead of Gateway API configuration.

	### 1. Create a `Gateway`

	If you already have a `Gateway` you can use that instead

	```yaml
	apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
	kind: Gateway
	metadata:
		name: example-gateway
		namespace: default
	spec:
		gatewayClassName: ngrok
		addresses:
		- type: Hostname
			value: 1.tcp.ngrok.io
		listeners:
			- name: p12345
				port: 12345
				protocol: TCP
	```

	### 2. Create a `TCPRoute`

	```yaml
	apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2
	kind: TCPRoute
	metadata:
		name: example-tlsroute
		namespace: default
	spec:
		parentRefs:
			- name: example-gateway
				sectionName: p12345
		rules:
			- backendRefs:
					- name: example-service
						port: 9000
	```
	</TabItem>
