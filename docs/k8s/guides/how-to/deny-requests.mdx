# Protecting Your Endpoints by Denying Unwanted Traffic

Whenever your endpoints are exposed to the internet, they will inevitably receive unwanted or malicious traffic. This can include bot activity, unauthorized access attempts, abusive requests, or even potential security threats.

By denying requests at the edge, you can:

🚫 Block unauthorized access attempts before they reach your upstream service. <br />
⚡ Reduce load on backend services by filtering unnecessary traffic. <br />
🔐 Improve security by rejecting requests based on predefined rules. <br />


## 🔍 What are the Benefits of Denying Requests?

Publicly exposed services are constantly targeted by automated scanners, bots, and unwanted traffic.
Even if these requests are not inherently malicious, they can consume resources, increase latency, and degrade performance.

Key Benefits:

- **Reduce Attack Surface:** Stop unauthorized access attempts before they hit your backend.
- **Harden API Security:** Restrict access to only legitimate users and trusted sources.
- **Improve Performance:** Free up server resources by dropping unwanted requests early.
- **Protect Against Malicious Bots & Scanners:** Prevent automated scripts and scrapers from overloading your API.
- Deny requests based on geolocation rules to comply with regulations.
- Prevent excessive requests from bad actors or misconfigured clients.

## Denying Requests Examples

The following examples set up an endpoint that will deny all traffic unless the client IP is from the EU.

See the [IP Intelligence](/traffic-policy/variables/ip-intel) page for more ways you can check properties of the connecting IP address.
Check out the [deny request traffic policy action](/traffic-policy/actions/deny/) page for more details about how it functions and the parameters it accepts.

	💡 `Ingress` resources do not natively support request denial configuration, but they can be extended using a traffic policy.

	### 1. Create an `NgrokTrafficPolicy`

	```yaml
  apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
  kind: NgrokTrafficPolicy
  metadata:
    name: example-tp
    namespace: default
  spec:
    policy:
      on_http_request:
        - expressions:
            - conn.client_ip.geo.location.is_eu == false
          actions:
            - type: deny
              config:
                status_code: 403
	```

	### 2. Use the `NgrokTrafficPolicy` on an `Ingress`

	```yaml
  apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: Ingress
  metadata:
    annotations:
      k8s.ngrok.com/traffic-policy: example-tp
    name: example-ingress
    namespace: default
  spec:
    ingressClassName: ngrok
    rules:
      - host: example-hostname.ngrok.io
        http:
          paths:
            - path: /
              pathType: Prefix
              backend:
                service:
                  name: example-service
                  port:
                    number: 80
	```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="gateway-api" label="Gateway API">
	💡 Gateway API resources do not natively support request denial configuration, but they can be extended using a traffic policy.

	### 1. Create an `NgrokTrafficPolicy`

	```yaml
  apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
  kind: NgrokTrafficPolicy
  metadata:
    name: example-tp
    namespace: default
  spec:
    policy:
      on_http_request:
        - expressions:
            - conn.client_ip.geo.location.is_eu == false
          actions:
            - type: deny
              config:
                status_code: 403
	```

	### 2. Use the `NgrokTrafficPolicy` on a `Gateway`

	The following example showcases supplying the `NgrokTrafficPolicy` on a `Gateway` resource. All requests to the `Gateway` will run the traffic policy.
	If you prefer, `NgrokTrafficPolicy` can also be used on the route level by using an `externalRef` filter on an `HTTPRoute`. See the [using Gateway API guide](/k8s/guides/using-gwapi) for examples.

	```yaml
  apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: Gateway
  metadata:
    name: example-gateway
    namespace: default
    annotations:
      k8s.ngrok.com/traffic-policy: example-tp
  spec:
    gatewayClassName: ngrok
    listeners:
      - name: example-hostname
        hostname: "example-hostname.ngrok.io"
        port: 443
        protocol: HTTPS
