Transport Layer Security (TLS) routing enables your API Gateway to handle encrypted traffic based on the Server Name Indication (SNI) without needing to terminate the connection. By default, TLS traffic is routed without termination, preserving full end-to-end encryption. However, TLS termination can be enabled if your use case requires it.

Proper TLS routing enables:

üîí End-to-end encryption by default, with optional termination. <br /> üåê SNI-based routing to differentiate between secure services. <br /> üèó Support for multi-tenant architectures using a single IP and port. <br />

## üîç What are the Benefits of TLS Routing?

TLS routing is ideal for environments where secure communication must be preserved from client to backend. 
With SNI-based routing, the gateway can route requests without accessing the payload, maintaining user privacy and compliance.

A well-configured API Gateway can route TLS traffic using:

- SNI-based rules (e.g., api.example.com ‚Üí API service, auth.example.com ‚Üí Auth service).
- TLS passthrough (default): Maintain end-to-end encryption without terminating TLS at the gateway.
- TLS termination (optional): Handle TLS termination at the gateway if you don't want your upstream services to terminate TLS.


## TLS Routing Examples

The following examples showcase how you can route TLS traffic to your upstream services.

See the [TLS Endpoints page](/docs/universal-gateway/tls/) for more details on how ngrok handles TLS endpoints.

<Tabs groupId="kind" queryString="kind">
	<TabItem value="agentendpoint" label="AgentEndpoint">
	```yaml
	apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
	kind: AgentEndpoint
	metadata:
		name: example-service
		namespace: default
	spec:
		url: tls://example-hostname.ngrok.io:8443
		upstream:
			url: tls://example-service.example-namespace:8443
	```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="endpoints" label="CloudEndpoint with AgentEndpoint">

	### 1. Create an `AgentEndpoint` for your upstream `Service`
	```yaml
	apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
	kind: AgentEndpoint
	metadata:
		name: example-service
		namespace: default
	spec:
		url: tls://example-service.internal:8443
		upstream:
			url: tls://example-service.example-namespace:8443
	```

	### 2. Create a `CloudEndpoint` that routes to the `AgentEndpoint`

	```yaml
	apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
	kind: CloudEndpoint
	metadata:
		name: example-cloud-endpoint
	spec:
		url: tls://example-hostname.ngrok.io:8443
		trafficPolicy:
			policy:
				on_http_request:
				- actions:
					- type: forward-internal
						config:
							url: tls://example-service.internal:8443
	```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="gateway-api" label="Gateway API">

	For TLS and TCP Routes, you must put the domain in the `Gateway.Spec.Addresses` field as the ngrok operator needs to know what domains to use when creating endpoints for you and Gateway API forbids using the hostname field
	on Gateway listeners for TCP/TLS protocols.

	Since the `Gateway.Spec.Addresses` are expected to bind to all listeners, you may want to create separate Gateways for TLS and TCP endpoints to prevent unwanted conflicts and overlap.
	For these reasons, TCP and TLS routing is often more easily configurable using the `AgentEndpoint` resources directly instead of Gateway API configuration.

	### 1. Create a `Gateway`

	If you already have a `Gateway` you can use that instead

	```yaml
	apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
	kind: Gateway
	metadata:
		name: example-gateway
		namespace: default
	spec:
		gatewayClassName: ngrok
		addresses:
		- type: Hostname
			value: example-hostname.ngrok.io
		listeners:
			- name: p9000
				port: 9000
				protocol: TLS
	```

	### 2. Create a `TLSRoute`

	```yaml
	apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2
	kind: TLSRoute
	metadata:
		name: example-tlsroute
		namespace: default
	spec:
		parentRefs:
			- name: example-gateway
				sectionName: p9000
		rules:
			- backendRefs:
					- name: example-service
						port: 9000
	```
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>
