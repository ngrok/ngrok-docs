# HTTP Header Templates
---------------

When using any of our features that manipulate HTTP header values, variables can be interpolated into a header value using [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) expressions surrounded by `${}` syntax. For example, using `${.ngrok.request_id}` as a header value will cause it to be filled in with the ngrok-generated Request ID.

Depending on the modules you leverage in your secure tunnel or cloud edge, you will have access to different objects that you can use for templating. For example, the variable `${.basic_auth.username}` is only available if you are using basic auth on your tunnel or endpoint.

## Examples

##### Add the basic auth username to the username header

    ngrok http --request-header-add 'username:${.basic_auth.username}' 3000

##### Add the two letter country code to the geo-country header

    ngrok http --request-header-add 'geo-country:${.ngrok.geo.country_code}' 3000

## Template Variables

### Backend Template Variables {#backend}

| --- | --- |
| `${.backend.connection_reused}` | True if ngrok reused a TCP connection to transmit the HTTP request to the upstream service. |
| `${.backend.dial_duration}` | The time to establish a connection from ngrok to the agent. |
| `${.backend.id}` | This is the ngrok ID of the backend that serviced this request. This is empty for secure tunnels since there is no backend. |

| --- | --- |
| `${.circuit_breaker.decision}` | Whether the HTTP request was sent to the upstream service. 'allow' if the breaker was closed, 'block' if the breaker was open, 'allow\_while\_open' if the request was allowed while the breaker is open. |

| `${.compression.bytes_saved}` | The difference between the size of the raw response and the size of the response as compressed by ngrok. |

### Connection Template Variables {#conn}

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| `${.conn.bytes_in}` | The number of bytes arriving at an endpoint from the frontend. |
| `${.conn.bytes_out}` | The number of bytes leaving an endpoint to the frontend. |
| `${.conn.client_ip}` | The source IP of the TCP connection to the ngrok edge. |
| `${.conn.duration}` | The total duration (in seconds) of the TCP connection between the ngrok endpoint and the agent. |
| `${.conn.end_ts}` | The timestamp when the TCP connection to the ngrok edge is closed. |
| `${.conn.id}` | The ngrok ID for this TCP connection. |
| `${.conn.server_ip}` | The IP address of the server that received the request. |
| `${.conn.server_name}` | The hostname associated with this connection. |
| `${.conn.server_port}` | The port that the connection for this request came in on. |
| `${.conn.start_ts}` | The timestamp when the TCP connection to the ngrok edge is established. |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| `${.ngrok.geo.country_code}` | This is the two-letter ISO country code based on the client IP. |
| `${.ngrok.geo.lat_long_radius_km}` | This is the radius in kilometers around the latitude and longitude where the client IP is likely to originate. |
| `${.ngrok.geo.latitude}` | This is the approximate latitude based on the client IP. |
| `${.ngrok.geo.longitude}` | This is the approximate longitude based on the client IP. |

| `${.http.request.version}` | The HTTP version used in the request. |
| `${.http.response.status_code}` | The status code of the response returned by the ngrok edge. |

### IP Policy Template Variables {#ip-policy}

Note: These values are only available when using the IP Policy module.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| `${.ip_policy.decision}` | 'allow' if IP Policy module permitted the request to the upstream service, 'block' otherwise. |
