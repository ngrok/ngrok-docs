# TCP Edge
----------------

A TCP edge can be used to share any non-HTTP protocols with the world. It's a generic edge that you can use to send SSH, VNC, RDP, SQL, or any other networked protocol.

### TCP Edge Modules

Modules can be added to a TCP edge to restrict traffic flowing through that edge. Here are the available modules for the TCP edge.

| Module | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [IP Restrictions](/cloud-edge/modules/ip-restrictions) | IP Restrictions allow you to attach one or more IP policies to the edge. |
