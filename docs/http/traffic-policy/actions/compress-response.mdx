# Compress Response

## Overview

The Compress Response policy action enables you to improve the performance of your web applications
by compressing HTTP response bodies returned by your upstream service.

If an HTTP request includes an `Accept-Encoding` header, HTTP responses will be
automatically compressed and a `Content-Encoding` response header will be
added. If the response was already compressed by your upstream service, ngrok
takes no action.

## Example

Use this action config in your [Traffic Policy](/docs/http/traffic-policy/index.mdx)

<ExampleHTTP />

_Request:_

```shell
curl https://example.ngrok.app/api/v1
```

_Result:_

```shell
< HTTP/2 200
< content-encoding: gzip
< content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8

<compressed-body-here>
```

## Behavior

### Streaming Compression

When ngrok performs compression, the response body is not buffered; the
response body is compressed as it is streamed through the ngrok endpoint.

### Algorithm Choice

If a request specifies `Accept-Encoding` but no requested values are supported,
ngrok takes no action and the upstream response is returned without
modification.

ngrok negotiates the encoding type as defined by the RFC for `Accept-Encoding`.
It respects q-values and chooses the `Accept-Encoding` supported algorithm with
the highest q-value.

ngrok supports the following compression algorithms in the `Accept-Encoding`
header by default, but this list may be restricted through policy action configuration.

| Algorithm  |
| ---------- |
| `br`       |
| `compress` |
| `deflate`  |
| `gzip`     |

### Response Headers

When ngrok performs compression, the following changes are made to
the HTTP response header:

- The `Content-Length` header is removed
- A `Content-Encoding` header is added with the negotiated algorithm
- A `Vary: Accept-Encoding` header is added
