# Remove Headers

## Overview

The Remove Headers policy action enables the removal of headers to both inbound and outbound traffic.

## Example

Use this action config in your [Traffic Policy](/docs/http/traffic-policy/index.mdx)

## Behavior

the configured headers. When executed as an outbound policy, the configured headers are removed to the response from the upstream server.
