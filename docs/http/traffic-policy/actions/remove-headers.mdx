# Remove Headers

## Overview

The Remove Headers policy action enables the removal of headers to both inbound and outbound traffic.

## Example

[Traffic Policy](/docs/http/traffic-policy/index.mdx) for removing headers from an incoming request.

<ExampleHTTP />

_Request:_

```shell
curl -H "is-internal: true" -H "ngrok-trace-id: abc123" https://example.ngrok.app/api/v1
```

_Result:_

```shell
> GET https://example.ngrok.app/v1 HTTP/2
> date: 2024-06-24T15:30:00Z
```

## Behavior

When executed as an inbound policy, this action will remove headers on an incoming http request before reaching the upstream server with
the configured headers. When executed as an outbound policy, the configured headers are removed to the response from the upstream server.
