# Rate Limit

## Overview

The Rate Limit policy action allows you to configure thresholds that restrict
the throughput of traffic that successfully reaches your endpoint. Traffic may
be limited overall or by attributes of the incoming requests.

## Example

Use this action config in your [Traffic Policy](/docs/http/traffic-policy/index.mdx)

<ExampleHTTP />

## Behavior

When this action is executed, information from the incoming HTTP request is
used to determine which rate limit bucket the request falls into. If that
bucket has received more events than its capacity over the specified duration,
the request is rejected with an `HTTP 429 â€” Too Many Requests` status code. The
`retry-after` header is set to a value in seconds after which the request may
be retried. Otherwise, the request proceeds to the next action in your policy
configuration.

Currently, the `capacity` for each bucket is applied per ingress server.

| `algorithm`  | string            | The rate limit algorithm to be used. Supported options: `"sliding_window"`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `capacity`   | uint              | The maximum number of requests allowed to reach your upstream server. The minimum capacity is `1` and the maximum capacity is `2,000,000,000`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `rate`       | string            | The duration in which events may be limited based on the current capacity. This must be specified as a time duration that is a multiple of ten seconds (e.g. `"90s"`, `"10m"`). The minimum value is `"60s"` and the maximum value is `"24h"`.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `bucket_key` | Set&lt;string&gt; | The elements of this collection define the unique key of a request to collect and track the rate at which the capacity is being met. Possible values are `"req.Host"`, which is the Host, `"conn.ClientIP"`, and `"req.Headers['x-example-header-name']"` or the related macro `getReqHeader('x-example-header-name')`, which is the value for the specified header key, if it exists. Up to ten bucket keys can be specified. |
