# Rate Limit

## Overview

The Rate Limit policy action allows you to configure thresholds that restrict
the throughput of traffic that successfully reaches your endpoint. Traffic may
be limited overall or by attributes of the incoming requests.

## Example

[Traffic Policy](/docs/http/traffic-policy/index.mdx) rate limit based on incoming `Host`.

<ExampleHTTP />

_Request:_

```shell
curl https://example.ngrok.app/api/v1
```

_Result: (when limiting)_

```shell
< HTTP/2 429
< retry-after: 86
```

## Behavior

When this action is executed, information from the incoming HTTP request is
used to determine which rate limit bucket the request falls into. If that
bucket has received more events than its capacity over the specified duration,
the request is rejected with an `HTTP 429 — Too Many Requests` status code. The
`retry-after` header is set to a value in seconds after which the request may
be retried. Otherwise, the request proceeds to the next action in your policy
configuration.

Currently, the `capacity` for each bucket is applied per ingress server.

| `rate`       | string            | The duration in which events may be limited based on the current capacity.

| `bucket_key` | Set&lt;string&gt; | The elements of this collection define the unique key of a request to collect and track the rate at which the capacity is being met. Possible values are `"req.host"`, which is the Host, `"conn.client_ip"`, and `"req.headers['x-example-header-name']"` or the related macro `getReqHeader('X-Example-Header-Name')`, which is the value for the specified header key, if it exists. Up to ten bucket keys can be specified. |
