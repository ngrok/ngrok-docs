# Custom Response

## Overview

The Custom Response policy action returns a hard-coded response back to the client that made a request to your endpoint.

## Example

<ExampleHTTP />

## Behavior

When executed as an inbound policy, this action bypasses the upstream server and immediately returns to the caller with
the configured response. When executed as an outbound policy, the response from the upstream server is overwritten with the
configured response.

If this action is executed, no further actions in the traffic policy will be executed.
