# Restrict IPs

## Overview

The Restrict IPs policy action enables you to allow or deny traffic based on the source IP
of the connection that was initiated to your ngrok endpoints. You can define rules in two ways, with CIDR blocks and with identifiers to existing ngrok IP Policies.

## Example

[Traffic Policy](/docs/http/traffic-policy/index.mdx) for restricting, allowing, and denying certain ips.

<ExampleHTTP />

_Request:_

```shell
curl https://example.ngrok.app/api/v1
```

_Result:_

```shell
< HTTP/2 403
```

## Behavior

This action evaluates the configured rules against the layer 4 source IP (`conn.client_ip`) of a connection. HTTP headers like `X-Forwarded-For` are never used.

A connection is allowed only if its source IP matches at least one of the allowed CIDRs and does not match any of the denied CIDRs.

The set of allowed and denied CIDRs are built from the CIDRs specified in the `allow` and `deny` fields as well as the CIDRs belonging to the ngrok IP Policies specified in the `ip_policies` field.

If this action denies the connection, a HTTP `403` response is returned. The upstream server is never reached. No further actions or policy rules in the policy configuration will be executed.
