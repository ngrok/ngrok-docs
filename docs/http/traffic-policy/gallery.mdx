# Rule Gallery

Explore a curated collection of example configurations spanning from common to unconventional use-cases for the Traffic Policy module.

## Deny non-GET requests:

This rule denies all inbound traffic that is not a GET request.

<Deny />
## Custom response for unauthorized requests

This rule sends a custom response with status code `401` and body `Unauthorized` for requests without an Authorization header.

<CustomResponse />
## Rate limiting for specific endpoint:

This rule applies rate limiting of `30` requests per second to the endpoint `/api/videos`.

<RateLimit />
## User agent filtering

We deliver tailored content to Microsoft Edge users by examining the `User-Agent` header for the case-insensitive string `(?i)edg/` succeeded by digits `\d`. To see how this works in practice, explore the following [regex101 demonstration](https://regex101.com/r/3NPVub/1).

To ensure correct decoding from YAML/JSON, it's necessary to properly escape the `\d` sequence. In YAML, if your string is not enclosed in quotes, use a single escape: `\\d`. However, when your string is wrapped in quotes, either in YAML or JSON, you need to double-escape: `\\\\d` for accurate decoding.

<UserAgentFilter />
