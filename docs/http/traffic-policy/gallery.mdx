# Rule Gallery

Explore a curated collection of example configurations spanning from common to
unconventional use cases for the Traffic Policy module.

A number of these examples come from a longer article about how ngrok [makes policy management accessible](https://ngrok.com/blog-post/api-gateway-policy-management-examples) to developers, including a simple Go-based application for testing these and other configurations.

See the following categories for specific expressions and actions:

- [Authentication](#authentication)
- [Rate limiting](#rate-limiting)
- [Block unwanted requests](#block-unwanted-requests)
- [Other](#other)

## Authentication

### Add JWT authentication and key-based rate limiting

Building from our [Auth0 guide](https://ngrok.com/docs/integrations/auth0/jwt-action/), these rules also add rate limiting based on your consumers' JWTs.

<JWTsRateLimiting />

## Rate limiting

### Rate limit for specific endpoint

This rule applies rate limiting of `30` requests per second to the endpoint
`/api/videos`.

<RateLimit />

### Rate limit API consumers based on authentication status

Create a low rate limit for unauthenticated (likely free) users, while allowing authenticated users a higher level of capacity.

<RateLimitAuthentication />

### Rate limit API consumers based on pricing tiers

Using a naming scheme in your upstream servers, and API calls using a `tier` header, you can quickly customize access to your API based on any number of pricing tiers.

<RateLimitPricing />

## Block unwanted requests

### Disallow bots and crawlers with a `robots.txt`

This rule returns a custom response with a [`robots.txt` file](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots/intro) to deny search engine or AI crawlers on all paths.

<AddRobotsTxt />

You can also extend the expression above to create specific rules for crawlers based on their user agent strings, like `ChatGPT-User` and `GPTBot`.

<AddRobotsTxtSpecific />

### Block bots and crawlers by user agent

In addition to, or instead of, denying bots and crawlers with a `robots.txt` file, you can also take action on only incoming requests that contain specific strings in the [`req.user_agent` request variable](/docs/http/traffic-policy/expressions/variables.mdx#requser_agent).

You can extend the expression to include additional user agents by extending `(chatgpt-user|gptbot)` like so: `(chatgpt-user|gptbot|anthropic|claude|any|other|user-agent|goes|here)`.

<BlockSpecificBots />

### Deny non-GET requests

This rule denies all inbound traffic that is not a GET request.

<Deny />

### Custom response for unauthorized requests

This rule sends a custom response with status code `401` and body `Unauthorized`
for requests without an Authorization header.

<CustomResponse />

### Block traffic from specific countries

Remain compliant with data regulations or sanctions by blocking requests originating from one or more countries using their respective [ISO country codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes).

<BlockCountries />

### Limit request sizes

Prevent excessively large user uploads, like text or images, that might cause performance or availability issues for your upstream service.

<LimitSize />

## Other

### User agent filtering

We deliver tailored content to Microsoft Edge users by examining the
`User-Agent` header for the case-insensitive string `(?i)edg/` succeeded by
digits `\d`. To see how this works in practice, explore the following
[regex101 demonstration](https://regex101.com/r/3NPVub/1).

To ensure correct decoding from YAML/JSON, it's necessary to properly escape the
`\d` sequence. In YAML, if your string is not enclosed in quotes, use a single
escape: `\\d`. However, when your string is wrapped in quotes, either in YAML or
JSON, you need to double-escape: `\\\\d` for accurate decoding.

<UserAgentFilter />

### Deprecate an API version

By include a `X-Api-Version` header in your API reference or developer documentation, you can quickly return a helpful error message, which encourages them to explore usage of the new version.

<DeprecateVersion />

### Manipulate request headers

Add new headers to requests to give your upstream service more context about the consumer, which in turn allows for richer functionality, such as localized languages and pricing.

<ManipulateHeaders />

### Add compression

Quickly ensure all JSON responses are [compressed](/docs/http/traffic-policy/actions/compress-response.mdx) en route to your API consumer. If your upstream service already handles compression, ngrok skips this step.

<AddCompression />

### Enforce TLS version

Prevent obsolete and potentially vulnerable browsers, SDKs, or CLI tools like `curl` from attempting to access your API.

<EnforceTLS />

### Log unsuccessful events

Connect your API to ngrok's [event logging system](/docs/obs/index.mdx) for smarter troubleshooting of your API gateway and upstream services.

<LogUnsuccessful />
