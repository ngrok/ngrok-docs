# Rule Gallery

Explore a curated collection of example configurations spanning from common to unconventional use-cases for the Traffic Policy module.

## Deny non-GET requests:

This rule denies all inbound traffic that is not a GET request.

<Deny />
## Custom response for unauthorized requests

This rule sends a custom response with status code `401` and body `Unauthorized` for requests without an Authorization header.

<CustomResponse />
## Rate limiting for specific endpoint:

This rule applies rate limiting of `30` requests per second to the endpoint `/api/videos`.

<RateLimit />
## User agent filtering

Here we are serving custom content to Microsoft Edge users by checking whether the `User-Agent` header has case insensitive `(?i)` string `edg/` followed by some digits `\d`. You can test this by viewing this [regex101 link](https://regex101.com/r/3NPVub/1).

Additionally, we have to escape the `\d` properly so it can be decoded from YAML / JSON. In YAML when your string is not wrapped in quotes you single-escape: `\\d` when it is wrapped in quotes you must double-escape: `\\\\d` for it to properly decode.

<UserAgentFilter />
