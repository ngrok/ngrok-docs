# Rule Gallery

Explore a curated collection of example configurations spanning from common to unconventional use-cases for the Traffic Policy module.

## Deny non-GET requests:

This rule denies all inbound traffic that is not a GET request.

<ConfigExample
	config={{
		inbound: [
			{
				expressions: ["req.Method != GET"],
				actions: [{ type: "deny" }],
			},
		],
	}}
/>

## Custom response for unauthorized requests

This rule sends a custom response with status code `401` and body `Unauthorized` for requests without an Authorization header.

<ConfigExample
	config={{
		inbound: [
			{
				expressions: ["!('Authorization' in req.Headers)"],
				actions: [
					{
						type: "custom-response",
						config: {
							status_code: 401,
							content: "Unauthorized",
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>

## Rate limiting for specific endpoint:

This rule applies rate limiting of `30` requests per second to the endpoint `/api/videos`.

<ConfigExample
	config={{
		inbound: [
			{
				expressions: ["req.URL.contains('/api/specific_endpoint')"],
				actions: [
					{
						type: "rate-limit",
						config: {
							name: "Only allow 30 requests per second",
							algorithm: "sliding_window",
							capacity: 30,
							rate: "1s",
							bucket_key: ["conn.ClientIP"],
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>
