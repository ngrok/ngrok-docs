# JWT Validation

## Overview

The JWT Validation module allows or denies traffic based on validation of the JSON Web Token (JWT) provided within the request that
was initiated to your ngrok endpoints. You will define the claims used to validate the token in conjunction with verifying it has been properly signed by the issuer.

A connection is allowed only if it has been signed by the issuer and the defined claims match.

patience.

**You can consult the [JWT Validation API documentation](https://ngrok.com/docs/api/resources/edge-route-jwt-validation-module/) in the interim.**

## Behavior

### Multiple Issuers

You may specify multiple Issuers to be used for JWT validation. A request
is considered validated if it presents a JWT signed by any of the
specified issuers.

### Multiple Audience Claims

You may specify multiple audience claims to be used for JWT validation. JWT validation will require one of the audience claims to be present within the JWT.

### Multiple JWS

You have the ability to provide multiple JWKS urls. During JWT validation the list of JWKS provided will be used to validate the JWT.

### Multiple Tokens

If multiple tokens are defined within the HTTP configuration parameter, all tokens must be present in the request. If all tokens are not present a 401 status code will be returned.

| **http**     | Configurations for handling JWT within a requests. Options include type of JWT and location within the request. |
| **jws**      | Configurations defining how the key was signed. Options include signing algorithms and url for the jwks.        |

### Upstream Headers {#upstream-headers}

This module does not add any upstream headers.

### Errors

| Code                | HTTP Status | Error                                                                |
| ------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| no ngrok error code | `401`       | This error is returned if the request is unauthorized.               |
| no ngrok error code | `403`       | This error is returned if the JWT cannot be validated by the issuer. |

### Events

This module does not populate any fields in events.

### Edges

JWT Validation is an HTTPS Edge module which can be applied to Routes.

When using JWT Validation via Edges, you specify an issuer, audience, token location, algorithms and JKUs.

JWT Validation can be configured via the ngrok dashboard or API.
