# OpenID Connect

This module restricts endpoint access to only users authorized by a OpenID
Identity Provider. Upstream servers behind an OIDC-protected endpoint can
safely assume that requests are from users authorized by the OIDC IdP to access
the protected resource.

:::note Coming Soon

This documentation is incomplete. Please check back later, we appreciate your

You can consult the [OAuth module documentation](/http/oauth) in the interim.
The OpenID Connect module works similarly.
