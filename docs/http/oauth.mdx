# OAuth

---

## Overview

The OAuth module enforces a browser-based OAuth flow in front of your HTTP
endpoints to an identity provider like Google.

See the [full list of OAuth providers](#supported-providers) that ngrok
supports.

Any client accessing an OAuth-protected endpoint will be redirected to the
chosen identity provider for authentication. When they are redirected back to
your endpoint, ngrok checks an optional set of authorization constraints (e.g.
email address). If authorized, the user is forwarded to your upstream
application and ngrok sets a cookie to avoid repeating the authentication flow.

ngrok [sets headers for your upstream service](#upstream-headers) with
information about the authenticated user.

To get started faster, ngrok maintains [managed OAuth
apps](#managed-applications) for some identity providers so you don't need to
bring your own client id and client secret. These managed OAuth applications
are shared among ngrok accounts and have some additional limitations.

## Example Usage

### Auth with Google

Require all users authenticate with Google before accessing your upstream
service.

You can also choose other [supported providers](#supported-providers) like
`github` or `microsoft`.

### Restrict by email and domain

Allow only users who authenticate via Google with an email of
`kate.libby@gmail.com` or emails that end in `acme.org` to access your upstream
service.

### Customize Scopes

Users must authenticate with GitHub and grant your application the `repo` and
`user` scopes to access your upstream service.

## Behavior

### Callback URL

When you create your own OAuth app, you must specify a 'Callback URL' or
'Redirect URL' to the OAuth provider. When using ngrok's OAuth module, that
Callback URL is always:

```
https://idp.ngrok.com/oauth2/callback
```

### Authentication

When an unauthenticated request is made to an OAuth-protected endpoint, it
returns a redirect response that begins an authentication flow with the
configured identity provider. The original URI path is saved so that users can
be redirected to it if they successfully authenticate.

**If the user fails to authenticate with the identity provider**, ngrok will
display an error describing the failure returned by the identity provider and
prompt them to try logging in again.

**If the user successfully authenticates with the identity provider**, ngrok
will take the following actions:

- Check any authorization constraints you've defined (like allowed
  emails or allowed email domains). If the user is not authorized, ngrok renders
  an error and prompts them to try logging in again.
- Sets a [session cookie](#cookies) to avoid repeating the authentication flow again.
- Redirects the user to the original URI path they were attempting to access
  before the authentication flow began. If no such URI path was captured, they
  are redirected to `/`.

### Continuous Authorization

When an authenticated user makes a request, ngrok will sometimes refresh a
user's data from the identity provider (email, name, etc) and re-evaluate
authorization constraints. This refresh is executed as a backchannel request to
the identity provider; it is transparent to the user and they do not go through
a reauthentication flow.

The following circumstances trigger refresh and authorization re-evaluation:

- On a periodic interval defined by the the [Auth Check
  Interval](#configuration) parameter.
- If you update the OAuth configuration of the endpoint by restarting your
  agent with a new configuration.
- If you update the OAuth configuration of the endpoint by modifying your Edge.

If a previously authenticated user becomes unauthorized because their identity
provider information changed or because the OAuth module configuration changed,
they are presented an error and are prompted to try logging in again.

### Managed Applications

Managed applications allow you to use ngrok's OAuth module without setting up
your own OAuth apps with the identity providers. More practically, this means
you can use the OAuth module without configuring a client id and client secret.

Managed applications are great for getting started but they have some
limitations.

- They are [only available for some identity providers](#supported-providers)
- You may not pass custom scopes when using a managed application.
- The [upstream headers](#upstream-headers) `ngrok-auth-oauth-access-token` and
  `ngrok-auth-oauth-refresh-token` are not sent to your application.

### App Users

ngrok's [App Users](/docs/network-edge/app-users/) feature can be used to observe
all of the authenticated user activity across your account in the ngrok
dashboard or via API. Whenever a user authenticates or accesses an endpoint
with a configured OAuth module, their App User record is created or updated.

You may also use App Users to remotely log a user out by [revoking a
session](/network-edge/app-users/#revoke-sessions).

### Cookies

This module sets two cookies in its operation. Cookies values are opaque to the
upstream service and must not be modified.

| Cookie    | Description                             |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `session` | Used to track an authenticated user.    |
| `nonce`   | Used to secure the authentication flow. |

| **Auth Check Interval**   | 0       | When a request is received after this interval has passed since the last auth check or the initial authentication, ngrok will re-validate its authorization constraints. As part of this process, ngrok refreshes data about the authenticated user from the identity provider. If zero, authorization is only ever checked during an authentication flow. |
| **Inactivity Timeout**    | 0       | If an authenticated client does not make a request to the endpoint within this duration, they are forced to reauthenticate.

| **Maximum Duration**      | 0       | An authenticated client session may never last longer than this duration. If 0, no maximum duration is enforced.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Options Passthrough**   | `false` | Don't enforce authentication on OPTIONS requests. Useful if this endpoint needs to be accessible via CORS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

### Upstream Headers {#upstream-headers}

This module adds headers to the HTTP request sent to your upstream service with
details about the OAuth user who has authenticated. These headers will not be
set for `OPTIONS` requests if you enable options passthrough.

| Header                           | Description                                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ngrok-auth-user-id`             | Provider-defined identifier of the authorized user.                         |
| `ngrok-auth-user-name`           | Full name of the authorized user.                                           |
| `ngrok-auth-user-email`          | Authorized user's primary email address.                                    |
| `ngrok-auth-oauth-access-token`  | The user's OAuth access token. Undefined when using a managed application.  |
| `ngrok-auth-oauth-refresh-token` | The user's OAuth refresh token. Undefined when using a managed application. |

### Special Paths

Upstream applications behind endpoints with this module enabled do not receive
any requests to paths beginning with `/auth/`. Your application may redirect
clients to the following paths to invoke different behaviors.

| Path           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/auth/authn`  | Redirect users to this path to explicitly begin an authentication flow. After authentication, users will be redirected to `/`. If the IdP supports it, ngrok will attempt to instruct the IdP to force reauthentication which will force users to re-enter their credentials with the IdP even if they were already logged in. |
| `/auth/logout` | Logs the user out by clearing their session cookie. Redirect users to this path to log them out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

### Events

When this module is enabled, it populates the following fields in the
[http_request_complete.v0](/obs/reference/#http-request-complete) event:

| Fields                |
| --------------------- |
| `oauth.app_client_id` |
| `oauth.decision`      |
| `oauth.user.id`       |
| `oauth.user.name`     |

### Pricing

MAU stands for "Monthly Active User". Monthly Active Users are the number of
uniquely authenticated OAuth users who have accessed your endpoints within a
month.

OAuth MAU usage is calculated account-wide. It is not calculated on a
per-endpoint basis.

An authenticated user with the same ID from the identity provider is counted as
a single MAU even if they connect to multiple endpoints on your account.

| Plan       | MAUs                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| Free       | 5                              |
| Personal   | 50                             |
| Pro        | Unlimited, usage-based-pricing |
