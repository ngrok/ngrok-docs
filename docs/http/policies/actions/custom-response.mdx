# Custom Response

## Overview 

The `custom-response` policy action returns a hard-coded response back to the client that made a request to your endpoint. 

## Behavior

When executed as an inbound policy, this action bypasses the upstream server and immediately returns to the caller with 
the configured response. When executed as an outbound policy, the response from the upstream server is overwritten with the
configured response. 

In both cases, if this action is executed, no further actions or policies in the policy configuration will be executed.
