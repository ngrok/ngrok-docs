# Compression

## Overview

This module improves the performance of your web applications by compressing
HTTP response bodies returned by your upstream service.

If an HTTP request includes an `Accept-Encoding` header, HTTP responses will be
automatically compressed and a `Content-Encoding` response header will be
added. If the response was already compressed by your upstream service, ngrok
takes no action.

## Behavior

### Streaming Compression

When ngrok performs compression, the response body is not buffered; the
response body is compressed as it is streamed through the ngrok edge.

### Algorithm Choice

If a request specifies `Accept-Encoding` but no requested values are supported,
ngrok takes no action and the upstream response is returned without
modification.

ngrok negotiates the encoding type as defined by the RFC for `Accept-Encoding`.
It respects q-values and chooses the `Accept-Encoding` supported algorithm with
the highest q-value.

ngrok supports the following compression algorithms in the `Accept-Encoding`
header.

| Algorithm  | Supported |
| ---------- | --------- |
| `br`       | no        |
| `compress` | no        |
| `deflate`  | yes       |
| `gzip`     | yes       |

### Response Headers

When ngrok performs compression, the following changes are made to
the HTTP response header:

- The `Content-Length` header is removed
- A `Content-Encoding` header is added with the negotiated algorithm
- A `Vary: Accept-Encoding` header is added

### Compression Level

The compression level is a value which indicates whether the compression
algorithm should prefer to save more space at the expense of being slower and
using more compute. This value is not currently configurable. ngrok
automatically chooses a value that provides a reasonable tradeoff.

## Reference

### Configuration

This module does not support any configuration. It is either enabled or
disabled.

### Events

When this module is enabled, it populates the following fields in
[http_request_complete.v0](/obs/reference/#http-request-complete) events.

| Fields                    |
| ------------------------- |
| `compression.algorithm`   |
| `compression.bytes_saved` |

## Try it out

For testing purposes, create a directory with a file in it and then enter that
directory.

```bash
mkdir test-dir
cd test-dir
echo "hello world" > t.txt
```

ngrok can serve files from any directory (just like Python's Simple HTTP
Server) by forwarding to a `file://` URL. We're going to use that capability
for our compression testing.

First let's see what this looks like without using compression by running the
following in your `test-dir` directory:

```bash
ngrok http file://`pwd` --url your-domain.ngrok.app
```

Then in another terminal while ngrok is still running:

```bash
curl --compressed -D - https://your-domain.ngrok.app/
```

- `--compressed` instructs curl to set the `Accept-Encoding` header to request
  compressed content
- `-D -` instructs curl to show the HTTP response headers

You should get a response that looks like:

```http
HTTP/2 200
content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
date: Tue, 18 Jul 2023 09:52:49 GMT
last-modified: Tue, 18 Jul 2023 09:52:34 GMT
ngrok-agent-ips: 71.227.75.230
ngrok-trace-id: 24e925dd0f348c1040d7ff62b06606cd
content-length: 39

<pre>
<a href="t.txt">t.txt</a>
</pre>
```

Now let's try it again with compression. Stop your ngrok agent and restart it
by changing the command to:

```bash
ngrok http file://`pwd` --url your-domain.ngrok.app --compression
```

Rerun the same curl command:

```bash
curl --compressed -D - https://your-domain.ngrok.app/
```

This time you should see that HTTP response headers include `content-encoding:
deflate` indicating that the response was compressed.

```http
HTTP/2 200
content-encoding: deflate
content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
date: Tue, 18 Jul 2023 10:03:22 GMT
last-modified: Tue, 18 Jul 2023 09:52:34 GMT
ngrok-agent-ips: 71.227.75.230
ngrok-trace-id: b6b6cdce029e94123188ce53c0febee4
vary: Accept-Encoding

<pre>
<a href="t.txt">t.txt</a>
</pre>
```
