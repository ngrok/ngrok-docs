# Basic Auth

## Overview

This modules enforces HTTP Basic Authentication in front of you endpoints.
Requests with a valid username and password will be sent to your upstream
service, all others will be rejected with a 401 Unauthorized response.

## Example Usage

Allow requests from two different users, each with a different password.

## Behavior

This module enforces HTTP Basic Auth as defined by [RFC
7617](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7617).

Requests with a valid username and password are sent to the upstream
application. All other requests receive an HTTP 401 response.

### Multiple Credentials

You may specify multiple username/password credential pairs. A request is
allowed if it matches any of the configured credentials.

```bash
ngrok http 80 \
  --basic-auth "user1:password1" \
  --basic-auth "user2:password2"
```

### Realm

The HTTP Basic Auth realm is always 'ngrok'. It may not be configured.

### Basic Auth on Upstream Service

If your upstream service also enforces HTTP Basic Auth, it is not recommended
to use this module with it. Instead, you should choose to either not use this
module or to disable http basic auth enforcement on your upstream service. If
you absolutely must use HTTP Basic Auth on both your ngrok endpoint and your
upstream service, you have two options:

1. Ensure that the username/password credentials enforced by ngrok and those
   enforced by the upstream service are identical. If you don't, no requests will
   ever be successful because they will always be rejected by either your ngrok
   endpoint or the upstream service.

2. Use the [Request Headers](/http/request-headers) module to rewrite the
   `authorization` header to the value expected by the upstream service. For
   example, if you want to accept requests with credentials of "username:password,
   but the upstream service expects credentials of "Aladdin:open sesame", you
   could use the following command. Keep in mind that you need to base64 encode
   the username and password for the upstream service.

```
ngrok http 80 \
  --basic-auth "username:password" \
  --request-header-remove "authorization" \
  --request-header-add "authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ=="
```

### Configuration

| Parameter       | Description                                                                                                                               |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Credentials** | A list of username/password pairs specified as 'username:password'. Passwords must be at least 8 characters and more than 128 characters. |

### Upstream Headers {#upstream-headers}

This module does not add any upstream headers.

### Errors

| Code                | HTTP Status | Error                                              |
| ------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| no ngrok error code | `401`       | This error is returned if a request is disallowed. |

### Events

This module does not populate any fields in events.
When this module is enabled, it populates the following fields in the
[http_request_complete.v0](/obs/reference/#http-request-complete) event:

| Fields                |
| --------------------- |
| `basic_auth.decision` |
| `basic_auth.username` |

## Try it out

Start ngrok in one terminal:

```bash
ngrok http https://httpbin.org --url your-domain.ngrok.app --basic-auth "falken:joshuahunter2"
```

In another terminal, curl that endpoint.

Without any credentials:

```bash
curl https://your-domain.ngrok.app/status/200
```

`401 Unauthorized`

With incorrect credentials:

```bash
curl https://your-domain.ngrok.app/status/200 --user "foo:bar"
```

`401 Unauthorized`

And finally with valid credentials:

```bash
curl https://your-domain.ngrok.app/status/200 --user "falken:joshuahunter2" -I
```

`HTTP/2 200`
