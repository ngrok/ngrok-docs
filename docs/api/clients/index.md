# API Clients
-----------

ngrok's API is designed to be simple enough to be called with `curl` and the HTTP library in your programming language of choice. We also believe that higher-level interfaces are better fits depending on the type of automation you're building. We publish a number of official API clients and tools that make automating your ngrok workflows easy.

We've also built API access into the latest ngrok agent v3 using the `ngrok api` command. For more information, check out the [ngrok agent reference](/docs/ngrok-agent/ngrok#command-ngrok-api).
