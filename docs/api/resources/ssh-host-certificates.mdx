# SSH Host Certificates

## Create SSH Host Certificate

Create a new SSH Host Certificate

### Request

POST /ssh_host_certificates

<SSHHostCertificatesCreateRequest />

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ssh_certificate_authority_id` | string | the ssh certificate authority that is used to sign this ssh host certificate |
| `public_key` | string | a public key in OpenSSH Authorized Keys format that this certificate signs |
| `principals` | List&lt;string&gt; | the list of principals included in the ssh host certificate. This is the list of hostnames and/or IP addresses that are authorized to serve SSH traffic with this certificate. Dangerously, if no principals are specified, this certificate is considered valid for all hosts. |
| `valid_after` | string | The time when the host certificate becomes valid, in RFC 3339 format. Defaults to the current time if unspecified. |
| `valid_until` | string | The time when this host certificate becomes invalid, in RFC 3339 format. If unspecified, a default value of one year in the future will be used. The OpenSSH certificates RFC calls this `valid_before`. |
| `description` | string | human-readable description of this SSH Host Certificate. optional, max 255 bytes. |
| `metadata` | string | arbitrary user-defined machine-readable data of this SSH Host Certificate. optional, max 4096 bytes. |

### Response

Returns a 201 response on success

| `description` | string | human-readable description of this SSH Host Certificate. optional, max 255 bytes. |
| `metadata` | string | arbitrary user-defined machine-readable data of this SSH Host Certificate. optional, max 4096 bytes. |
| `public_key` | string | a public key in OpenSSH Authorized Keys format that this certificate signs |
| `key_type` | string | the key type of the `public_key`, one of `rsa`, `ecdsa` or `ed25519` |
| `ssh_certificate_authority_id` | string | the ssh certificate authority that is used to sign this ssh host certificate |
| `principals` | List&lt;string&gt; | the list of principals included in the ssh host certificate. This is the list of hostnames and/or IP addresses that are authorized to serve SSH traffic with this certificate. Dangerously, if no principals are specified, this certificate is considered valid for all hosts. |
| `valid_after` | string | the time when the ssh host certificate becomes valid, in RFC 3339 format. |
| `valid_until` | string | the time after which the ssh host certificate becomes invalid, in RFC 3339 format. the OpenSSH certificates RFC calls this `valid_before`. |
| `certificate` | string | the signed SSH certificate in OpenSSH Authorized Keys format. this value should be placed in a `-cert.pub` certificate file on disk that should be referenced in your `sshd_config` configuration file with a `HostCertificate` directive |
