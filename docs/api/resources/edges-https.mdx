| `allow_idp_initiated` | boolean | If true, the IdP may initiate a login directly (e.g. the user does not need to visit the endpoint first and then be redirected).

Many IdPs do not support request signing verification, but we highly recommend specifying this in the IdP's configuration if it is supported. |
| `metadata_url` | string | A public URL where the SP's metadata is hosted. If an IdP supports dynamic configuration, this is the URL it can use to retrieve the SP metadata. |
| `nameid_format` | string | Defines the name identifier format the SP expects the IdP to use in its assertions to identify subjects. If unspecified, a default value of `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent` will be used. A subset of the allowed values enumerated by the SAML specification are supported. |

| `allow_idp_initiated` | boolean | If true, the IdP may initiate a login directly (e.g. the user does not need to visit the endpoint first and then be redirected).

Many IdPs do not support request signing verification, but we highly recommend specifying this in the IdP's configuration if it is supported. |
| `metadata_url` | string | A public URL where the SP's metadata is hosted. If an IdP supports dynamic configuration, this is the URL it can use to retrieve the SP metadata. |
| `nameid_format` | string | Defines the name identifier format the SP expects the IdP to use in its assertions to identify subjects. If unspecified, a default value of `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent` will be used. A subset of the allowed values enumerated by the SAML specification are supported. |

## Update HTTPS Edge

Updates an HTTPS Edge by ID. If a module is not specified in the update, it will not be modified. However, each module configuration that is specified will completely replace the existing value. There is no way to delete an existing module via this API, instead use the delete module API.
