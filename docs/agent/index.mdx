# ngrok Agent

## Overview

The ngrok agent is a lightweight command-line program that forwards traffic
from endpoints it creates on the ngrok edge to your upstream application
services.

The ngrok agent is a standalone native executable with zero runtime
dependencies. It runs on [all major operating systems](#system-requirements)
and it is packaged for distribution on most popular package managers.

The ngrok agent uses a simple [YAML configuration file](/agent/config),
can install itself as a native operating system service and also has a built-in
CLI for calling the [ngrok API](/api/).

## Install

Follow the [getting started guide](/getting-started/#step-1-install) or visit the [download page](https://ngrok.com/download) to install and set up the ngrok agent.

## Example Usage

### HTTP Endpoint

Serve your web app listening at port 8080 on a random public URL

<RandomHttpAgentCliExample />

### Static Domain

Serve a web app on example.ngrok.app

<StaticDomainAgentCliExample />

### Basic Auth

Secure your web app with a username + password

<BasicAuthAgentCliExample />

### Forward to non-local

Forward to a service not listening on localhost

<NonLocalAgentCliExample />

### Local HTTPS Server

Forward to an upstream service listening for `https`

<ForwardHttpsAgentCliExample />

### Forwarding to IPv6 Address

The ngrok agent can also forward to IPv6 addresses

<IPv6Example />

### TCP Endpoint

Accept traffic to a non-HTTP service.

<RandomTcpAgentCliExample />

### TLS Endpoint

Listen on `your-name.ngrok.app` for TLS traffic. It could be HTTPS, but any
protocol wrapped in TLS is accepted.

<TlsAgentCliExample />

### Multiple Endpoints

Start multiple tunnels defined in the [configuration file](/agent/config/).

```bash
ngrok start foo bar baz
```

## Tab Completion {#tab-completion}

The ngrok agent has built-in tab completion which makes it easy to navigate its
command and flags by hitting tab in your terminal when using a `bash` or `zsh`
shell. Add tab-completion to your shell session with:

```bash
. <(ngrok completion>
```

Install it permanently by following the documentation for the [`ngrok completion` command](/agent/cli/#ngrok-completion).

## Authtokens

The ngrok agent authenticates with an authtoken.
[Your authtoken is available on the ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
Add your authtoken to the ngrok agent with the following command:

```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken <TOKEN>
```

This command updates the `authtoken` property in your [ngrok configuration file](/agent/config).

Use a separate authtoken for each agent you configure. You can [provision additional authtokens on your ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/tunnels/authtokens) or [via API](/agent/config/#authtoken). Separate authtokens isolate the security risk
if an authtoken is compromised. It also allows you to configure
[ACLs](#authtoken-acls) on a per agent basis.

When you provision a new authtoken, the full token is only displayed once. As a security
feature, ngrok does not store a recoverable representation of the token.

## Authtoken ACLs

Authtoken ACLs restrict what actions an ngrok agent connecting with that
authtoken is allowed to take. You may define multiple ACLs. Authtokens with no
ACLs may take all actions. The following ACLs are supported:

| Example              | Description                                                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `bind:foo.ngrok.app` | The agent may only create an endpoint on `foo.ngrok.app`                 |
| `bind:*.example.com` | The agent may only create endpoints on subdomains of `example.com`       |
| `bind:foo=bar`       | The agent may create a labeled tunnel with the label `foo=bar`           |
| `bind:app=*`         | The agent may create labeled tunnels with labels like `app=x` or `app=y` |
| `bind:*`             | The agent may listen on all endpoints                                    |

## API Keys

The ngrok agent contains a [complete CLI for the ngrok API](/agent/cli/#ngrok-api).

To use it, [create an API Key on your ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/api) and then run:

```bash
ngrok config add-api-key <API KEY>
```

After you've installed the API Key, try querying your list of domains or online endpoints:

```bash
ngrok api endpoints list
ngrok api reserved-domains list
```

## Configuration File

The ngrok agent uses a [YAML configuration file](/agent/config) to customize
its behavior. The config file is useful if your configuration is too complex
for the command line and if you want the agent to run multiple tunnels
simultaneously.

Consult the [ngrok agent configuration file reference](/agent/config/)
for a full list of configuration file options.

## Environment Variables

The ngrok agent supports environment variables for some configuration.
Environment variables take precedence over the corresponding values specified
in the configuration file.

| Name              | Configuration Property                  |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `NGROK_AUTHTOKEN` | [`authtoken`](/agent/config/#authtoken) |
| `NGROK_API_KEY`   | [`api_key`](/agent/config/#api_key)     |

## Running ngrok in the background {#background-service}

ngrok includes commands to run itself in the background as a native operating
system service, i.e. as a daemon. When it runs as an operating system service it:

- Starts when the machine boots
- Automatically restarts after crashes
- Can be managed via native OS service tooling
- Sends logs to the OS's native logging service
- Starts all tunnels defined in the configuration file, the equivalent of running `ngrok start --all`

::::tip
In most cases, installing ngrok as a service requires administrator privileges.
::::

| OS      | Notes                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Linux   | The ngrok agent creates a `systemd` unit file. Errors and warnings are logged to `syslog`.                                                             |
| Windows | The ngrok agent installs itself as a Windows service. It can be managed via Windows Services. Errors and warnings are logged to the Windows event log. |
| MacOS   | The ngrok agent creates a plist file and configures itself to run via `launchd`. Errors and warnings are logged to `syslog`.                           |

#### Try it out

Create an ngrok [configuration file](#configuration-file). For this example,
we'll assume it's `C:\ngrok\ngrok.yml`. In your configuration file, make sure
you include the [`authtoken`](/agent/config#authtoken) property and define all
of the tunnels that you want to start. Then run:

```bash
ngrok service install --config C:\ngrok\ngrok.yml
```

This will validate that the configuration file is valid, and if so, install
ngrok as a service using the given configuration file. The service installation
includes the location of the ngrok executable and the configuration file, so
don't move or delete either after you've installed the service.

You can then start the ngrok agent service with:

```bash
ngrok service start
```

You can manage the agent with your OS's normal service tooling, but the agent
also includes the [`ngrok service` commands](/agent/cli/#ngrok-service) to
manage the installed service:

- `ngrok service start`
- `ngrok service stop`
- `ngrok service restart`
- `ngrok service uninstall`

::::tip
If you see an exit code `5` or `Input/output error`, it usually indicates that ngrok is not able to find the config file and/or does not have permissions to do so. Make sure you have installed the ngrok service with a valid config file and that when the service is run (either as you or an administrator) it has access to that same config file.
::::

## Remote Management

The ngrok agent can be stopped, restarted, or upgraded remotely using the
[Tunnel Sessions](/api/resources/tunnel-sessions#restart-tunnel-agent) API. You
can also perform these actions from the ngrok Dashboard.

::::warning
Use this with caution if you have made changes to the config file. If
for some reason ngrok cannot restart, you may lose access to the agent
completely.
::::

## Connectivity

When the ngrok agent and Agent SDKs start, they establish long-lived TLS
connections to the ngrok service through which they create new endpoints and
receive connections from ngrok's edge that are intended for your upstream
services.

### Address {#connectivity-address}

By default, the latest ngrok agent dials the following "agent ingress address" when it
connects to the ngrok service. This address resolves to a [dynamic set of IP Addresses](/network-edge/#ip-addresses).

```
connect.ngrok-agent.com:443
```

::::note
All connections to ngrok servers are made on port 443.
::::

You can [customize the agent ingress address](/agent/ingress/) to brand it with
your own domain.

The agent by default only connects to a single region. However connections to multiple regions can be created with traffic load balanced across these connections. If you are interested in this capability, please [contact us](https://ngrok.com/enterprise/contact).

The complete list of addresses and IP addresses available for the agent to connect to ngrok can be found in our [ngrok DNS tunnel.json file](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dns.ngrok.com/tunnel.json).

::::note
Prior to ngrok agent version 3.3.0, the ngrok agent connected to `tunnel.*.ngrok.com` domains. The latest agent uses `connect.*.ngrok-agent.com` domains.
::::

### Additional URLs

In addition to the addresses used for connecting to the ngrok server, the ngrok agent may reach out to the following URLs.

#### Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Check

The ngrok agent reaches out to the following domains to check for revoked certificates. This check can be disabled by adding `crl_noverify: true` to your ngrok agent config.

- Prior to ngrok agent version 3.10.0: `http://crl.ngrok.com/ngrok.crl`
- Latest versions: `http://crl.ngrok-agent.com/ngrok.crl`

::::note
These connections use HTTP and port 80.
::::

#### ngrok Agent Update Check

The ngrok agent will automatically look for updates when it starts up. This check can be disabled by adding `update_check: false` to your ngrok agent config.

- `https://update.equinox.io`

::::note
Even though the Equinox service was [shut down in 2021](https://equinox.io/blog/shutting-down), it is wholely owned and operated by ngrok, and as such, continues to be used for building and distributing our binaries.
::::

### DNS Resolution

When the ngrok agent dials the ngrok service to establish its TLS connections,
it resolves DNS for the [connection address](/agent/ingress/) which is defined
by the [`server_addr`](/agent/config/#server_addr) configuration property.
ngrok attempts to resolve DNS using multiple mechanisms so that it can
establish connectivity even in network environments where DNS service is
failing. ngrok attempts to resolve the IPs of its service using the following
mechanisms:

- Via the system's default DNS resolvers
- Via Google's DNS servers (`8.8.8.8` and `8.8.4.4`)
- Via Google's DNS-over-HTTPS service (https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/doh)
- Via a [file hosted on an ngrok-controlled S3 bucket](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dns.ngrok.com/tunnel.json)

Instead of using the system's default DNS resolvers, you can configure
the DNS servers the ngrok agent uses for resolution with the
[`dns_resolver_ips`](/agent/config/#dns_resolver_ips) configuration option.

### TLS Verification

The ngrok agent connects to the ngrok service over TLS connections. The agent
verifies the TLS Certificate returned by the ngrok service. The certificates
returned by the ngrok service are signed by ngrok's own root certificate
authority. The ngrok agent verifies the returned certificate against
certificate authorities bundled into the agent itself.

Lastly, the ngrok agent makes a request to `crl.ngrok-agent.com` to verify that the
certificate returned by the ngrok service has not been revoked. It is possible to skip this step by setting `crl_noverify: true` in your configuration file.

### Heartbeats

Once the ngrok agent has established connectivity to the ngrok service, it
periodically sends application-level heartbeat messages to validate the
liveness of the connection. You may customize this behavior via the
[`heartbeat_interval`](/agent/config/#heartbeat_interval) and
[`heartbeat_tolerance`](/agent/config/#heartbeat_tolerance) configuration
parameters.

If the ngrok agent does not receive a response to its heartbeat within the
tolerance window, it terminates the connection and begins reconnecting.

ngrok's heartbeat mechanism allows it to recover from any type of network
outage, even those caused by packet loss, dynamic IP changes, interface changes
(e.g. WiFi to LTE) or complete network outages.

The ngrok service also sends its own heartbeats to the agent which it uses to detect
liveness and terminate dead connections.

### Reconnection

If the ngrok agent is disconnected for any reason, it will automatically begin
reconnecting. Reconnecting begins the entire connection process over again,
beginning with DNS resolution. The ngrok agent attempts to recover quickly and
slowly backs off its reconnection attempts but always attempts to re-establish
connectivity unless the ngrok service explicitly instructs it to stop
reconnecting.

### Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting-connectivity}

If the ngrok agent can't connect to the ngrok service, it is often difficult to
understand why.

The ngrok agent includes the [`ngrok diagnose`](/agent/cli/#ngrok-diagnose)
command to help you troubleshoot connection failures. It runs a series of tests
to diagnose potential issues when connecting to the ngrok service. Consult the
[`ngrok diagnose` documentation](/agent/cli/#ngrok-diagnose) for additional
details.

```sh
$ ngrok diagnose
  Testing ngrok connectivity...

## System Requirements

#### Supported Platforms

The ngrok agent runs on all major platforms including Linux, MacOS, Windows and
most CPU architectures. See the [ngrok agent download](https://ngrok.com/download) page. It is also distributed as a Docker
container.

| OS      | Supported Architectures                                                                              |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows | 64-bit, 32-bit (`x86-64`, `x86`)                                                                     |
| MacOS   | Intel, Apple Silicon (`x86-64`, `arm64`)                                                             |
| Linux   | `x86-64`, `x86`, `arm`, `arm64`, `mips`, `mips64`, `mips64le`, `mipsle`, `ppc64`, `ppc64le`, `s390x` |
| FreeBSD | `x86-64`, `x86`, `arm`, `arm64`                                                                      |

If the agent does not run on your target platform, you can still use ngrok via
the [Agent SDKs](/agent-sdks/) or the [SSH Reverse Tunnel Agent](/agent/ssh-reverse-tunnel-agent).

#### Resource Requirements

The ngrok agent is lightweight enough to run most everywhere, even on many
embedded platforms. Keep in mind that the ngrok agent's resource usage depends
on how much concurrent traffic you drive through it. If your resource
requirements are more stringent, you can still use ngrok via the [Agent SDKs](/agent-sdks) or the [SSH Reverse Tunnel Agent](/agent/ssh-reverse-tunnel-agent).

| Resource | Value                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------- |
| Memory   | 64MB minimum, 128MB recommended |
| Disk     | 25MB                            |
| CPU      | No requirement                  |

:::tip

You can reduce memory usage in the ngrok agent by disabling
[inspection in the configuration file](/agent/config#inspect_db_size).

:::

## Updates

The ngrok agent can update itself even if you didn't install it with a package
manager. Update the ngrok agent with the [`ngrok update`](/agent/cli/#ngrok-update) command.

```bash
ngrok update
```

By default, the ngrok agent automatically checks for available updates when it
runs. If an update is available, it will prompt you to update by pressing
`Ctrl+U`. You can configure whether the agent checks for updates via the
[`update_check` config parameter](/agent/config/#update_check).

You can configure which release channel (e.g. `stable`, `beta`) the agent uses
for updates via the [`update_channel` config parameter](/agent/config/#update_channel).

## IP Restrictions

All agents must use an authtoken to authenticate with ngrok, but you may also
further restrict with IP Policies that specify which IPs and CIDRs agents may
connect to your ngrok account from.

- [IP Restrictions on your ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/security/ip-restrictions)
- [IP Restrictions API Resource](/api/resources/ip-restrictions/)

## API

The ngrok agent has its own HTTP API that can be used to dynamically inspect,
start and stop tunnels on the agent while it is running. Consult the
[ngrok agent API reference documentation](/agent/api/) for more details.

:::tip

If you want to programmatically control the ngrok agent, the [Agent SDKs](/agent-sdks/) are usually a more flexible and powerful choice.

:::

## Using ngrok without the agent

There are three ways to use ngrok without the agent:

- [Agent SDKs](/agent-sdks/)
- [Kubernetes Operator](/k8s/)
- [SSH Reverse Tunnel](/agent/ssh-reverse-tunnel-agent/)

You may want to use ngrok with one of the alternatives above if:

- You don't want to manage the lifetime of a separate agent process
- You don't want to bundle and distribute the ngrok agent
- The ngrok agent doesn't run on your target platform
- The ngrok agent's resource requirements are too high for your target platform
- You want fine-grained programmatic control over the agent's functionality

## Changelog

We publish the [ngrok agent changelog](/agent/changelog) with details on
each release of the ngrok agent.

## Pricing

The ngrok agent is available to all ngrok users at no additional charge. You
only incur costs if the resources provisioned by the agent incur a cost. For more information, see the [ngrok Pricing page](https://ngrok.com/pricing).
