title: Agent TLS Termination
description: Secure your traffic with end-to-end encryption by allowing your ngrok agents to terminate TLS.
---

import ConfigExample from "/src/components/ConfigExample.tsx";

Agent TLS termination enables you to secure your traffic with end-to-end encryption without needing to reconfigure your server.

:::tip
If your service doesn't support TLS termination, you can still use Agent TLS termination with [Zero-Knowledge TLS](/universal-gateway/tls-termination/#end-to-end-encryption).
:::

The following instructions will guide you through setting up Agent TLS termination with ngrok.

## What you'll need

- Ensure you have [openssl](https://docs.openiam.com/docs-4.2.1.3/appendix/2-openssl) installed.

## 1. Generate a cert and key pair

The following command:

1. Generates a new certificate signing request (CSR) for a 4096-bit RSA key pair.
   - The key is saved to `your-key.key`.
1. Creates a self-signed certificate which:
   - Is in x509 format and uses the SHA-256 hash algorithm.
   - Is valid for 365 days.
   - Is saved to `your-cert.crt`.

```bash
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -x509 -sha256 -days 365 -noenc -out your-cert.crt -keyout your-key.key
```

## 2. Configure your endpoint

You can configure your endpoint with an [agent configuration file](/agent/config/). To create a new configuration file with your generated cert and key pair, run the following command:

```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken you-authtoken
```

Your generated configuration file should resemble the following:

```yaml
version: 3
agent:
  authtoken: your-authtoken
endpoints:
  - name: demo-tls
    url: "tls://your-domain.ngrok.app"
    upstream:
      url: 12345
    agent_tls_termination:
      server_certificate: /path/to/your-cert.crt
      server_private_key: /path/to/your-key.key
```

:::tip
You can run `ngrok config edit` to open the configuration file in your default text editor. [Learn more about the `ngrok config` command](/agent/cli/#ngrok-config).
:::

## 3. Start your endpoint

Next, use `ngrok start endpoint_name_here` in the terminal to start an endpoint using the settings in your agent configuration file, as shown below:

```bash
ngrok start demo-tls
```

## 4. Start your upstream server

Start an upstream server on the specified port (e.g., `12345`) to handle incoming requests. The following example uses Python, but you can use any language or framework depending on your requirements.

```python
import socket

host='127.0.0.1'
port=12345
server = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server.bind((host, port))
print(f"Server started on {host}:{port}")
server.listen(1)

while True:
    client, client_address = server.accept()
    print(f"Connection established with {client_address}")
    client.sendall(b"hello, world!")
    client.close()
    print(f"Connection with {client_address} closed")
```

## 5. Try connecting to your endpoint

The following example uses `openssl s_client` to initiate an SSL/TLS client connection to your upstream server without a certificate.

```bash
openssl s_client -quiet -connect your-domain.ngrok.app:443 -verify_return_error
```

```bash
Connecting to 2600:1f16:d83:1200::6e:0
depth=0 C=AU, ST=Some-State, O=Internet Widgits Pty Ltd, CN=your-domain.ngrok.app
verify error:num=18:self-signed certificate
408FB6F801000000:error:0A000086:SSL routines:tls_post_process_server_certificate:certificate verify failed:ssl/statem/statem_clnt.c:2093:
```

The following example uses `openssl s_client` to initiate an SSL/TLS client connection to your upstream server with a certificate.

```bash
openssl s_client -quiet -connect your-domain.ngrok.app:443 -verify_return_error -CAfile your-cert.crt
```

```bash
Connecting to 2600:1f16:d83:1200::6e:0
depth=0 C=AU, ST=Some-State, O=Internet Widgits Pty Ltd, CN=your-domain.ngrok.app
verify return:1
hello, world!%
```

:::note
The extra arguments added to the command suppress most of the output so that only the data exchanged with the server will be displayed.
