# Agent Config Version 3

The ngrok agent supports an optional, YAML configuration file which enables you to configure advanced settings and run multiple endpoints simultaneously.

The agent configuration file location depends on your system. You can check the location of your configuration file by running `ngrok config check` or edit the file in your terminal by running `ngrok config edit`.

## Breaking Changes

There are important differences between the v3 ngrok Agent Configuration file and v2:

- Agent configuration options are no longer top-level, they are now nested under the `agent` field.
- Endpoints are now configured through the `endpoints` field.
- Deprecated the `tunnels` field in favor of `endpoints`.
- Changed `server_addr` agent configuration field to `connect_url`.
- Changed `root_cas` agent configuration field to `connect_cas`.

## Migrating from v2

Migrating from v2 to v3 requires you to update to the latest agent, nest your agent configuration
options under the `agent` field and change the `version` field to `3` as well as modify any [agent
configuration fields that have changed](#breaking-changes).

For example, here is an example v2 configuration file:

```yaml
version: 2
authtoken: 4nq9771bPxe8ctg7LKr_2ClH7Y15Zqe4bWLWF9p
api_key: 24yRd5U3DestCQapJrrVHLOqiAC_7RviwRqpd3wc9dKLujQZN

tunnels:
  basic:
    proto: http
    addr: 80
```

For v3, you need to update the `version` and introduce the `agent` field:

```yaml {1,3-5}
version: 3

agent:
  authtoken: 4nq9771bPxe8ctg7LKr_2ClH7Y15Zqe4bWLWF9p
  api_key: 24yRd5U3DestCQapJrrVHLOqiAC_7RviwRqpd3wc9dKLujQZN

tunnels:
  basic:
    proto: http
    addr: 80
```

You will also need to adjust the following fields if you are using them:

- Change `root_cas` to `connect_cas`
- Change `server_addr` to `connect_url`

## Supported Fields

The ngrok Agent Configuration file supports the following top-level configuration fields:

- [Configuration File Version Field](#version) - `version` (required)
- [Agent Configuration Field](#agent-configuration) - `agent` (required)
- [Endpoint Definitions](#endpoint-definitions) - `endpoints`
- [Tunnel Definitions](#tunnels-deprecated) - `tunnels` (deprecated)

## Version

The top-level `version` field is **required**. Value **must** be `3`.

#### Example

```yaml
version: 3
```

## Agent Configuration

The top-level `agent` field is **required**. The agent field allows you to modify both general and advanced agent configuration options, everything from your authtoken to whether the agent should check for updates.

| `8.8.8.8`            |         | an IP matches `Host` header (`8.8.8.8`)                                                                                                  |
| `1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8`    |         | an IPv6 matches `Host` header (`1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8`)                                                                                        |
| `10.0.0.0/8`         |         | a CIDR range matches a `Host` header that is an IP address in that range (`10.0.0.1 or 10.1.2.3`)                                        |
| `1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8/16` |         | a CIDR range matches a `Host` header that is an IPv6 address in that range (`1:2:3:4:5:6:7:0`)                                           |
| `example.com`        |         | a hostname without preceding period will match `Host` header exactly (`example.com`)                                                     |
| `.example.com`       |         | a hostname with a preceding period `Host` header suffix (`sub.example.com` or `foo.example.com`)                                         |

##### Example

Allow an IP address and a domain as `Host` headers:

```yaml {2-4}
agent:
  web_allow_hosts:
    - 8.8.8.8
    - example.com
```

## Endpoint Definitions

The `endpoints` field enables you to define and configure multiple endpoints.

Defining multiple endpoints this way enables you to start pre-configured endpoints
by name without having to memorize the right arguments every time through the
`ngrok start` command. You can also use this field to start multiple endpoints at
the same time from a single agent using the `ngrok start --all` flag.

The endpoints field accepts a list of endpoint configurations, the list of available
endpoint configuration options can be found here.

### Example

In the snippet below we are defining two endpoints named 'httpbin' and 'demo':

```yaml
endpoints:
  - name: httpbin
    url: https://alan-httpbin.ngrok.dev
    upstream:
      url: 8080
  - name: demo
    url: https://demo.inconshreveable.com
    upstream:
      url: 8181
```

#### Start the endpoint named 'httpbin'

```sh
ngrok start httpbin
```

#### Start all endpoints

```sh
ngrok start --all
```

## Tunnels (Deprecated)

v3 still supports the `tunnels` configuration field. This is a key-value list of tunnel name to configurations.

An example can be found below:

```yaml
# Version of the ngrok Agent Configuration file. Required.
version: 3

# Agent Configuration
agent:
  authtoken: 4nq9771bPxe8ctg7LKr_2ClH7Y15Zqe4bWLWF9p

# Tunnel Configurations
tunnels:
  basic:
    proto: http
    addr: 80
```

### Tunnel Configuration Options

You can find the configuration options for `tunnels` under the [Agent Configuration v2 docs](/docs/agent/config/v2/#tunnel-configurations).

## Example Configuration Files

Below are a collection of different agent configurations to serve as examples for your `ngrok.yml` file.

### Basic

Here is a basic example configuration file, in this example we are authenticating
using our authtoken and defining a single HTTPS endpoint named `basic` with a
endpoint url `basic.ngrok.app` and an upstream url of `localhost:8080`.

```yaml
# Version of the ngrok Agent Configuration file. Required.
version: 3

# Agent Configuration
agent:
  authtoken: 4nq9771bPxe8ctg7LKr_2ClH7Y15Zqe4bWLWF9p

# Endpoint Definitions
endpoints:
  - name: basic
    url: basic.ngrok.app
    upstream:
      url: 8080
```

#### Starting the `basic` endpoint

Run the following command to start the basic endpoint. Make sure you update the
authtoken in the example to your own before running the following command:

```
ngrok start basic
```

### Multiple Endpoints

```yaml
# Version of the ngrok Agent Configuration file. Required.
version: 3

# Agent Configuration. Required.
agent:
  authtoken: 4nq9771bPxe8ctg7LKr_2ClH7Y15Zqe4bWLWF9p

# Endpoint Definitions
endpoints:
  - name: foo
    description: foo123
    metadata: foo123
    url: foo.ngrok.io
    upstream:
      url: 8080
      protocol: http1
  - name: bar
    url: bar.ngrok.io
    upstream:
      url: 8080
```

### Endpoint with Inline Traffic Policy

```yaml
# Version of the ngrok Agent Configuration file. Required.
version: 3

# Agent Configuration. Required.
agent:
  authtoken: 4nq9771bPxe8ctg7LKr_2ClH7Y15Zqe4bWLWF9p

# Endpoint Definitions
endpoints:
  - name: foo
    description: foo123
    metadata: foo123
    url: foo.ngrok.io
    # Traffic Policy that will be applied to this endpoint
    traffic_policy:
      inbound:
        - actions:
            - type: custom-response
              config:
                status_code: 200
                content: hello, traffic policy!
                headers:
                  content-type: text/plain
    upstream:
      url: 8080
      protocol: http1
```

### Endpoint with Traffic Policy File

```yaml
# Version of the ngrok Agent Configuration file. Required.
version: 3

# Agent Configuration. Required.
agent:
  authtoken: 4nq9771bPxe8ctg7LKr_2ClH7Y15Zqe4bWLWF9p

# Endpoint Definitions
endpoints:
  - name: bar
    url: bar.ngrok.io
    # Path to the traffic policy to be read and applied to this endpoint
    traffic_policy_file: /path/to/your/traffic-policy.yml
    upstream:
      url: 8080
      protocol: http2
```

### Endpoint with a random address

Here is an example configuration where ngrok will randomly assign your endpoint an ngrok branded address:

```yaml
# Version of the ngrok Agent Configuration file. Required.
version: 3

# Agent Configuration. Required.
agent:
  authtoken: 4nq9771bPxe8ctg7LKr_2ClH7Y15Zqe4bWLWF9p

# Endpoint Definitions
endpoints:
  # Endpoint with no endpoint url defined to get a randomly assigned ngrok address.
  - name: my_tunnel_name
    #url: http://  # uncomment this line if you want your endpoint to be HTTP, by default it's HTTPS
    upstream:
      url: 80
```
