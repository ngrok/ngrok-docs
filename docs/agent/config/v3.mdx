title: "Version 3"

## Breaking Changes

- [Agent specific fields](/docs/agent/config/v3/#agent-configuration) are no longer top level-keys, but instead nested under the **required** `agent` field.
- There are now four top-level keys: `version`, `agent`, `endpoints`, and `tunnels`.
- `tunnels` are deprecated in favor of `endpoints`.

```yaml
version: 3
agent:
  authtoken: 4nq9771bPxe8ctg7LKr_2ClH7Y15Zqe4bWLWF9p
  # add nested "Agent Configuration" fields here
  # ...
endpoints: ...
tunnels: # deprecated
```

For a complete list of nested `agent` fields, check out [agent configuration](/docs/agent/config/v3/#agent-configuration).

## Example Configuration Files

Below are a collection of different agent configurations to serve as examples for your `ngrok.yml` file. The [next section](/docs/agent/config/v3/#endpoint-configurations) explains how to start some or all of your configured endpoints from the CLI.

### Basic

```yaml
version: 3
agent:
  authtoken: 4nq9771bPxe8ctg7LKr_2ClH7Y15Zqe4bWLWF9p
endpoints:
  - name: basic
    url: basic.ngrok.app
    upstream:
      url: 8080
```

### Multiple endpoints

```yaml
version: 3
agent:
  authtoken: 4nq9771bPxe8ctg7LKr_2ClH7Y15Zqe4bWLWF9p
endpoints:
  - name: foo
    description: foo123
    metadata: foo123
    url: foo.ngrok.io
    upstream:
      url: 8080
      protocol: http1
  - name: bar
    url: bar.ngrok.io
    upstream:
      url: 8080
```

### Endpoint with an traffic policy (inline)

```yaml
version: 3
agent:
  authtoken: 4nq9771bPxe8ctg7LKr_2ClH7Y15Zqe4bWLWF9p
endpoints:
  - name: foo
    description: foo123
    metadata: foo123
    url: foo.ngrok.io
    traffic_policy:
      inbound:
        - actions:
            - type: custom-response
              config:
                status_code: 200
                content: hello, traffic policy!
                headers:
                  content-type: text/plain
    upstream:
      url: 8080
      protocol: http1
```

### Endpoint with a traffic policy (file path)

```yaml
version: 3
agent:
  authtoken: 4nq9771bPxe8ctg7LKr_2ClH7Y15Zqe4bWLWF9p
endpoints:
  - name: bar
    url: bar.ngrok.io
    traffic_policy_file: /path/to/your/traffic-policy.yml
    upstream:
      url: 8080
      protocol: http2
```

## Endpoint configurations

> **Looking for _Tunnel_ configurations?**
>
> Tunnel configurations are still supported in the new `Version 3` configuration file format. However, they're being _deprecated_ in favor of endpoints, which provide a simpler and more powerful way of managing ingress. If you wish to see documentation on how to enable and configure tunnels, refer to the [version 2 tunnel configuration](/docs/agent/config/v2#tunnel-configurations) section.

The most common use of the configuration file is to define endpoint
configurations. Defining endpoint configurations is useful because you may then
start pre-configured endpoints by name from your command line without remembering
all of the right arguments every time. You may also use this method to start as
many endpoints as you like from a single ngrok agent.

Endpoints are defined as mapping of name -> configuration under the `endpoints`
property in your configuration file.

##### Define two endpoints named 'httpbin' and 'demo'

```yaml
endpoints:
  - name: httpbin
    url: https://alan-httpbin.ngrok.dev
    upstream:
      url: 8080
  - name: demo
    url: https://demo.inconshreveable.com
    upstream:
      url: 8181
```

##### Start the endpoint named 'httpbin'

```sh
ngrok start httpbin
```

Each endpoint you define is a map of configuration option names to values. The name of a configuration option is usually the same as its corresponding command line switch with hyphens.

_eg:_

- `--description` becomes `description`
- `--url` becomes `url`

All endpoints must define a specific `url` that tells the agent where to send the traffic. Other properties are available and many are protocol-specific.

##### Start all endpoints defined in the configuration file

```sh
ngrok start --all
```

You can configure a single ngrok agent to start multiple endpoints to different services within a single agent session.

##### Common Endpoint Configuration Properties

| Name          | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `url`         | required | forward traffic to this network address. This can be a _domain_ `example.ngrok.app`, an _origin_ `https://example.ngrok.app`, or a _scheme_ shorthand `https://` |
| `metadata`    | Optional | arbitrary user-defined metadata that will appear in the ngrok service API when listing endpoint sessions                                                         |
| `description` | Optional | arbitrary user-defined description about this endpoint that will appear in the ngrok service API when listing endpoint sessions                                  |

### HTTP Configuration

| Name                                                                                     | Type                                                                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

### `api_key`

This option specifies the API key used to access the ngrok API through the [`ngrok api`](/agent/cli#ngrok-api) command. This is only needed when using the [ngrok API](/api) and not the local ngrok agent API (available at `localhost:4040/api`). You can generate an API Key in the [ngrok Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/api) and install it using the `ngrok config add-api-key` command.

##### ngrok.yml specifying an API key

```yaml
agent:
  api_key: 24yRd5U3DestCQapJrrVHLOqiAC_7RviwRqpd3wc9dKLujQZN
```

### `authtoken`

This option specifies the authentication token (sometimes called tunnel credential) used to authenticate this agent when it connects to the ngrok service. After you've created an ngrok account, your dashboard will display the authtoken assigned to your account.

Your authtoken will work on multiple machines if you are just developing. When you want to deploy many agents on many devices, you can generate a unique authtoken for each device in the ngrok Dashboard or via the `ngrok api credentials` command.

##### ngrok.yml specifying an authtoken

```yaml
agent:
  authtoken: 4nq9771bPxe8ctg7LKr_2ClH7Y15Zqe4bWLWF9p
```

### `connect_interface`

```

### `proxy_url`

This is the URL of an HTTP or SOCKS5 proxy to use for establishing the tunnel connection. Many HTTP proxies have connection size and duration limits that will cause ngrok to fail. Like many other networking tools, ngrok will also respect the environment variable `http_proxy` and `http_proxy_env` if it is set.

### `remote_management`

Set this to `true` to allow the ngrok agent to be remotely managed (stop, restart, update) via the [ngrok API](/api/resources/tunnel-sessions#restart-tunnel-agent) or the [ngrok Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/tunnels/agents). Defaults to `true`.
