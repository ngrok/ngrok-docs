# Agent Ingress Address

---

## Overview

The Agent Ingress Address is the network address that the ngrok agent and agent
SDKs use to connect to when ngrok service. The default agent ingress address is
`connect.ngrok-agent.com:443`.

## Customize Agent Ingress Address

You can customize the ingress address by creating your own Agent Ingress. You
do this by delegating control of a DNS subdomain. ngrok will then populate the
A/AAAA records and issue the certificates for your new agent ingress address.
Lastly, you must update the `ngrok.yml` [config file](/agent/config/) to instruct
your ngrok agent to connect to the new address.

Agents authenticating to your agent ingress address must authenticate to your
ngrok account. Agents attempting to authenticate with credentials for other
accounts through your ingress address are disallowed.

### Create the Agent Ingress

When you create a new agent ingress, you specify the domain you wish to use.
You must own this domain yourself and have the ability to create `NS` records
on it via your DNS provider.

- **[Create a new Agent Ingress on the ngrok
  Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/tunnels/ingress)**
- **[Create a new Agent Ingress via API](/docs/api/resources/agent-ingresses/)**

### Delegate DNS records

After you create a new Agent Ingress, you will be prompted to create `NS`
records on the domain you chose.

### Update agent configuration

Finally, you must reconfigure your ngrok agent or agent SDKs to use your new
agent ingress address by adding the [`server_addr`](/docs/agent/config#server-addr)
option to your ngrok agent's configuration file.

For example, if the domain of your custom agent ingress is
`ingress.example.com` then you might add the following line to the agent's
configuration file:

<Tabs groupId="connectivity" queryString="cty">
	<TabItem value="agent-cli" label="Agent CLI">
		<CustomIngressAgentCliExample />
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="agent-config" label="Agent Config" default>
		<CustomIngressAgentConfigExample />
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="ssh" label="SSH" default>
		<CustomIngressSshExample />
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="go-sdk" label="Go SDK">
		<CustomIngressGoSdkExample />
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="rust-sdk" label="Rust SDK">
		<CustomIngressRustSdkExample />
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="k8s" label="Kubernetes Controller">
		<CustomIngressKubernetesExample />
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Incompatibility with GSLB

:::note

Custom agent ingress requires the you choose a particular region that your
agent connects to. It does not yet support [Global Server Load
Balancing](/network-edge/gslb) which allows the agent to connect to the closest
ngrok point of presence.

Endpoints created by agents using custom agent ingress are still delivered with
Global Server Load Balancing.

:::

## Dedicated IPs

When you create a custom agent ingress, the DNS, certificates and hostnames are
all custom branded but you address will still resolve to ngrok's shared set of
IP addresses. Dedicated IPs that are unique for your account are also available
at additional cost. [Contact us](mailto:support@ngrok.com) to get in touch for
additional details.

## Why customize the ingress address?

### Branded Connectivity

If you are using ngrok for production connectivity to your devices in the field
or APIs inside of your customers' networks, a custom ingress address allows you
to brand ngrok's connectivity as your own.

### Policy Enforcement

If you are using ngrok for development and testing, you can use your own
ingress address to ensure everyone at your org does not use their personal
accounts and instead uses a shared ngrok account with appropriate observability
and security controls set up. You can do this by blocking ngrok's default
ingress address of from your machines and networks, but allowing traffic to
your custom ingress address.

## Pricing

Creating your own Agent Ingress is not available on any self-serve plan.

ingress.
