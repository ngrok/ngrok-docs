# Agent Ingress Address

## Overview

The Agent Ingress Address is the network address that the ngrok agent and agent
SDKs use to connect to the ngrok service. The default agent ingress address is
`connect.ngrok-agent.com:443`. This is defined in your agent configuration file
under the [`server_addr`](/docs/agent/config/#server_addr) parameter.

## Customize Agent Ingress Address

You can customize the ingress address by creating your own Agent Ingress. You
do this by delegating control of a DNS subdomain. ngrok will then populate the
A/AAAA records and issue the certificates for your new agent ingress address.
Lastly, you must update the `ngrok.yml` [config file](/agent/config/) to instruct
your ngrok agent to connect to the new address. You can use the helper command
[`ngrok config add-server-addr`](/docs/agent/cli/#ngrok-config-add-server-addr) to do this.

Agents authenticating to your agent ingress address must authenticate to your
ngrok account. Agents attempting to authenticate with credentials for other
accounts through your ingress address are disallowed.

### Create the Agent Ingress

When you create a new agent ingress, you specify the domain you wish to use.
You must own this domain yourself and have the ability to create `NS` records
on it via your DNS provider.

- **[Create a new Agent Ingress on the ngrok
  Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/tunnels/ingress)**
- **[Create a new Agent Ingress via API](/docs/api/resources/agent-ingresses/)**

:::note

When creating a new custom agent ingress, there is an option to configure the
Certificate Issuer from either ngrok or Let's Encrypt. Some networks do not
trust traffic encrypted with our privately issued certificate and will require
a public issuer such as Let's Encrypt and this allows you to choose which one is needed.

:::

### Delegate DNS records

After you create a new Agent Ingress, you will be prompted to create `NS`
records on the domain you chose.

### Update agent configuration

Finally, you must reconfigure your ngrok agent or agent SDKs to use your new
agent ingress address by adding the [`server_addr`](/docs/agent/config/#server_addr)
option to your ngrok agent's configuration file. You can use the helper command
[`ngrok config add-server-addr`](/docs/agent/cli/#ngrok-config-add-server-addr) to do this.

For example, if the domain of your custom agent ingress is
`ingress.example.com` then you might add the following line to the agent's
configuration file:

<Tabs groupId="connectivity" queryString="cty">
	<TabItem value="agent-cli" label="Agent CLI">
		<CustomIngressAgentCliExample />
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="agent-config" label="Agent Config" default>
		<CustomIngressAgentConfigExample />
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="ssh" label="SSH" default>
		<CustomIngressSshExample />
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="go-sdk" label="Go">
		<CustomIngressGoSdkExample />
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="javascript-sdk" label="Javascript">
		<CustomIngressJavascriptSdkExample />
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="python-sdk" label="Python">
		<CustomIngressPythonSdkExample />
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="rust-sdk" label="Rust">
		<CustomIngressRustSdkExample />
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="k8s" label="Kubernetes Controller">
		<CustomIngressKubernetesExample />
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Incompatibility with GSLB

:::note

Custom agent ingress requires the you choose a particular region that your
agent connects to. It does not yet support [Global Server Load
Balancing](/network-edge/gslb) which allows the agent to connect to the closest
ngrok point of presence.

Endpoints created by agents using custom agent ingress are still delivered with
Global Server Load Balancing.

## Dedicated IPs

When you create a custom agent ingress, the DNS, certificates and hostnames are
all custom branded but your address will still resolve to ngrok's shared set of
IP addresses. Dedicated IPs that are unique for your account are also available
at additional cost. [Contact us](mailto:support@ngrok.com?subject=Dedicated+Ingress+IPs) to get in touch for
additional details.

## Certificate Issuer

When you create a custom agent ingress, you have the option to choose between
two certificate issuer options: ngrok's internal CA and a public one from
[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

### ngrok's Internal CA

With this option, the agent uses a private cert minted from ngrok. This is the default option and the agent trusts
automatically. This cert is provisioned immediately, but may require additional
configuration if you are using 3rd party security tools as they most likely won't trust the ngrok-issued
certificate.

### Let's Encrypt Cert Issuer

This option will request a certificate from Let's Encrypt. This is not automatically trusted by the agent and
requires the `root_cas` option to be set to `host`, or the Let's Encrypt root
cert. In most cases, the host that runs the agent will trust a standard set of
public CAs. You will also need this when using any ngrok agent SDK or SSH Reverse Tunnel agent.

This certificate is not immediately provisioned and after provision, could take up to 48 hours if propagation is
slow. An ngrok certificate is provisioned and used in the meantime to secure any communication. Note that
even if the DNS "Check Status" succeeds in the ngrok dashboard, it may not have
propagated to Let's Encrypt yet.

This option is useful if getting an outbound proxy to trust `ngrok` CA is
challenging due to either technical or organizational constraints.

If Let's Encrypt is selected, the agent ingress drawer will show the following
card while the certificate is provisioning:

## Why customize the ingress address?

### Branded Connectivity

If you are using ngrok for production connectivity to your devices in the field
or APIs inside of your customers' networks, a custom ingress address allows you
to brand ngrok's connectivity as your own.

### Policy Enforcement

If you are using ngrok for development and testing, you can use your own
ingress address to ensure everyone at your org does not use their personal
accounts and instead uses a shared ngrok account with appropriate observability
and security controls set up. You can do this by blocking ngrok's default
ingress address of from your machines and networks, but allowing traffic to
your custom ingress address.

## Pricing

Creating your own Agent Ingress is not available on any self-serve plan.

ingress.
