## v2

### ngrok Agent 2.3.X

If asked to forward to port 443, ngrok will now automatically forward HTTPS traffic instead of HTTP. This change would only affect you if you previously ran a server accepting unencrypted HTTP on port 443. To workaround this, you may specify an explicit http URL if you need the old behavior: `ngrok http http://localhost:443`.

If run under sudo, the ngrok agent previously consulted the sudo-ing user's home directory file when looking for its default configuration file. It now consults the home directory of the assumed user. To workaround this, you may specify an explicit configuration file location with the `-config` option.

### ngrok Agent 2.2.X

The ngrok agent API no longer accepts `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` request bodies. In practice, this only affects the `/api/requests/http/:id` endpoint because posting to the `/api/tunnels` endpoint with this type of request body previously caused ngrok to crash.

This change was made to help protect against maliciously crafted web pages that could cause a user to inadvertently interact with their local ngrok API.

### ngrok Agent 2.1.X

Behavior changes for `http` and `tls` tunnels defined in the configuration file or started via the API that do not have a `subdomain` or `hostname` property.

```yaml
tunnels:
  webapp:
    proto: http
    addr: 80
```

Given this example tunnel configuration, behavior will change in the following ways.

##### Old Behavior

Starts a tunnel using the name of the tunnel as the subdomain resulting in the URL `http://webapp.ngrok.io`

##### New Behavior

Starts a tunnel with a random subdomain, for example a URL like `http://d95211d2.ngrok.io`

##### How to keep the old behavior

Add a `domain` property with the same name as the tunnel:

```yaml
tunnels:
  webapp:
    proto: http
    addr: 80
    domain: webapp.ngrok.io
```
