# Version Support Policy

# Overview

This document applies to the following products:

- ngrok Agent

## Versioning

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), and limit breaking changes to major upgrades.

## Cadence

Our typical minor release happens at least quarterly while our typical patch release is at least monthly. Critical bug fixes may cause a more immediate release outside of the normal cadence. We also aim not to make releases during major US holiday periods.

## Support Period

In accordance with our release cadence, ngrok will support a minor release for 14 months. Support includes:

- Patches
- Critical Security Fixes

Towards the end of the 14-month support period, the following will happen:

- The two-month upgrade cycle will begin. During the last two months of a support period, the following will apply:
  - No more patches or critical security fixes will occur.
  - Announcements will be made attempting to notify users through the following channels:
    - Via email
    - Via social media
    - Status Page
    - Documentation Page
    - That releaseâ€™s agent banner

After the two-month upgrade cycle has ended, the following will happen:

- The Agent version will enter end-of-life and will **no longer be able to connect to ngrok's cloud network**. Attempting to connect with an unsupported agent will result in an error message.

## Extended Support

Extended support beyond LTS is available to customers on a commercial basis. It includes critical security fixes only. [Contact us](mailto:support@ngrok.com?subject=Extended%20Support%20Inquiry) for additional details.
