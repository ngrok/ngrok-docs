# ngrok Agent Configuration File

## Overview

The ngrok agent supports an optional, YAML configuration file which provides
you with the power to run multiple tunnels simultaneously as well as to tweak
some of its more advanced settings.

## Default Locations

The default location of the ngrok agent's configuration file varies based on your operating system. The easiest way to find the configuration file location is to run:

    ngrok config check

which will validate and print the location of the configuration file.

For the main operating systems we support, their default file locations are:

- Linux: `"~/.config/ngrok/ngrok.yml"`
- MacOS (Darwin): `"~/Library/Application Support/ngrok/ngrok.yml"`
- Windows: `"%HOMEPATH%\AppData\Local\ngrok\ngrok.yml"`

## Config File Merging

The `--config` flag in the `ngrok` command allows you to specify one or more
ngrok configuration files to merge when starting the ngrok agent. The rules for
merging are as follows:

- Values from later configs override those from earlier configs. For example, if config1.yml and config2.yml both set `api_key`, then calling `ngrok http --config config1.yml,config2.yml 80` will use the `api_key` from config2.yml.
- Lists are overwritten using the last value.
- Maps, including the `tunnels` map, are merged by key and in the case of a duplicate key, the latter value is taken.

## Full Example

## Tunnel configurations

The most common use of the configuration file is to define tunnel
configurations. Defining tunnel configurations is useful because you may then
start pre-configured tunnels by name from your command line without remembering
all of the right arguments every time. You may also use this method to start as
many tunnels as you like from a single ngrok agent.

Tunnels are defined as mapping of name -> configuration under the `tunnels`
property in your configuration file.

##### Define two tunnels named 'httpbin' and 'demo'

    tunnels:
      httpbin:
        proto: http
        addr: 8000
        domain: alan-httpbin.ngrok.dev
      demo:
        proto: http
        addr: 9090
        domain: demo.inconshreveable.com
        inspect: false

##### Start the tunnel named 'httpbin'

    ngrok start httpbin

Each tunnel you define is a map of configuration option names to values. The name of a configuration option is usually the same as its corresponding command line switch with hyphens (`--host-header` becomes `host_header:` in the configuration file and `--scheme` becomes `schemes`. Tunnels can define a specific `proto` or use labels to dynamically connect to one or more matching ngrok Edges. All tunnels must define a specific `addr` that tells the agent where to send the traffic. Other properties are available and many are protocol-specific.

##### Common Tunnel Configuration Properties

|            |          |                                                                                                        |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `addr`     | required | forward traffic to this local port number or network address. This can be just a port (                |
| `metadata` | Optional | arbitrary user-defined metadata that will appear in the ngrok service API when listing tunnel sessions |

##### Define two labeled tunnels

    tunnels:
      my-cool-website:
        labels:
          - env=prod
          - team=infra
        addr: 8000
        inspect: false
      ssh-tunnel:
        labels:
          - hostname=my-hostname
          - service=ssh
          - team=development
        addr: 22

:::tip

When you used labeled tunnels, the `protocol` and `domain` are configured by the matching edge.

### `api_key`

This option specifies the API key used to access the ngrok API through the [`ngrok api`](/agent/cli#ngrok-api) command. This is only needed when using the [ngrok API](/api) and not the local ngrok agent API (available at `localhost:4040/api`). You can generate an API Key in the [ngrok Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/api) and install it using the `ngrok config add-api-key` command.

##### ngrok.yml specifying an API key

    api_key: 24yRd5U3DestCQapJrrVHLOqiAC_7RviwRqpd3wc9dKLujQZN

### `authtoken`

This option specifies the authentication token (sometimes called tunnel credential) used to authenticate this agent when it connects to the ngrok service. After you've created an ngrok account, your dashboard will display the authtoken assigned to your account.

Your authtoken will work on multiple machines if you are just developing. When you want to deploy many agents on many devices, you can generate a unique authtoken for each device in the ngrok Dashboard or via the `ngrok api credentials` command.

##### ngrok.yml specifying an authtoken

    authtoken: 4nq9771bPxe8ctg7LKr_2ClH7Y15Zqe4bWLWF9p

### `connect_timeout`

| `iftty` | default | Enable the UI only if standard out is a TTY (not a file or pipe) |

### `console_ui_color`

The command sets the background color when displaying the console UI in the terminal. To choose a color other than black, set the value to transparent and change the background of your terminal window.

|               |         |                                                             |
| ------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `transparent` |         | Don't set a background color when displaying the console UI |

### `heartbeat_interval`

How often the ngrok agent should heartbeat to the ngrok servers defined as a duration. The default is 10s.

### `heartbeat_tolerance`

Reconnect the agent tunnel session if the server does not respond to a heartbeat within this tolerance defined as a duration. The default is 15s.

### `inspect_db_size`

This is the upper limit in bytes on memory to allocate when saving requests over HTTP tunnels for inspection and reply. The default is 0, which means 50MB.

|                   |         |                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| positive integers |         | size in bytes of the upper limit on memory to allocate to save requests over HTTP tunnels for inspection and replay. |

| `-1`              |         | disable the inspection database; this has the effective behavior of disabling inspection for all tunnels             |

| other values |         | write log records to file path on disk |

    log: /var/log/ngrok.log

### `metadata`

This is a user-supplied custom string that will be returned as part of the ngrok API response to the [list online sessions resource](/api/resources/tunnel-sessions) for all tunnels started by this agent. This is a useful mechanism to identify tunnels by your own device or customer identifier. Maximum 4096 characters.

    metadata: bad8c1c0-8fce-11e4-b4a9-0800200c9a66

### `proxy_url`

This is the URL of an HTTP or SOCKS5 proxy to use for establishing the tunnel connection. Many HTTP proxies have connection size and duration limits that will cause ngrok to fail. Like many other networking tools, ngrok will also respect the environment variable `http_proxy` if it is set.

### `region`

This is the region where the ngrok agent will connect to. You can only choose one region per agent session. Choosing the region closest to you usually improves latency and performance. By default, the ngrok agent attempts to choose the best region for you.

### `root_cas`

This is the root certificate authorities used to validate the TLS connection to the ngrok server.

| `host`       |         | use the root certificates trusted by the host's operating system. This is helpful for working with machine-in-the-middle (MITM) proxies doing deep packet inspection (DPI). |
| other values |         | path to a certificate PEM file on disk with certificate authorities to trust                                                                                                |

### `server_addr`

This is the URL of the ngrok server to connect to. You should set this if you are using a custom ingress URL.

### `tunnels`

This is a map of names to tunnel definitions. See [tunnel definitions](#tunnel-configurations) for more details.

### `update_channel`
