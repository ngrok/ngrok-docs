## Agent

Agent in the context of the ngrok documentation refers to the ngrok agent. The ngrok agent is a command line application or language sdk that you use to start tunnels.

## Reserved Domain

Reserved domains are any domains you add to the ngrok platform. This includes custom or generated subdomains on an ngrok domain (e.g. `example.ngrok.dev`), custom domains (e.g. `example.com`) and wildcard domains (e.g. `*.example.com` or `*.subdomain.example.com`).

## Base Domain

Base domains are umbrellas under which all subdomains are made available (e.g. `example.com` is both a base and custom domain).

## Custom Domain

A custom domain is a domain that you own and would like to use on the ngrok platform (e.g. `example.com`).

## ngrok Domains

Domains owned by ngrok allow you to serve traffic via a generated or custom subdomain without you having to own your own custom domain.

Current list of base domains ngrok manages for subdomains:

- `ngrok.app`
- `ngrok.dev`
- `ngrok-free.app`
- `ngrok-free.dev`
- `ngrok.pizza`
- `ngrok.pro`
- `ngrok.io`

## Wildcard Domain

Wildcard domains are domains that match all existing and non-existing subdomains on a domain. A wildcard domain is specified by using an asterisk `*` as the leftmost part of a domain name, e.g. `*.example.com`.

ngrok permits you to bind HTTP and TLS tunnels to wildcard domains. For paid users, ngrok base domains also have wildcard support.

All wildcard domains must be reserved with the asterisk `*` to be treated as a wildcard domain, e.g. `*.example.com` or `*.example.ngrok.app`.

When adding a custom wildcard domain, you will need to configure two CNAME records in your DNS provider, a domain record as well as an automated TLS record, also known as an [ACME Challenge](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#dns-01-challenge).
For additional domains under your wildcard domain, such as `api.example.com`, you do not need to configure any additional CNAME records. ngrok will automatically use the records from the wildcard domain to validate the domain is owned and available to you account.


## Endpoint

Endpoints are mappings the way that ngrok maps reserve domains to tunnels or edges. Edges can have multiple endpoints while a tunnel can only have one endpoint.

## Route

Routes allow you to define protocol-specific rules for mapping inbound traffic requests to ngrok agents running on your infrastructure.

## Catch-all Route

Catch-all routes are routes that use prefix matching to allow you to match multiple url paths under a specific path. An example of this is matching all traffic on an edge `/*`.

## Backend

Backends allow you to define how you want to load balance traffic to agents through routes. You can use the same backend for multiple routes, or a different backend for each route, depending on your use case.
