# Limits in ngrok's free plan
Below are the limits enforced in the ngrok free plan. For more details on increasing or removing these limits, refer to the (ngrok paid plans)[ngrok.com/pricing?ref=limits-docs].

##​Endpoints
###What is an endpoint?
An endpoint is any device, app, or API that connects to a computer network. When you put an app online at foo.ngrok.com (using your free static domain), that’s one endpoint. If you connect to a device using a TCP protocol at 9.67. 1.100, that’s another endpoint.

As a free user of ngrok, you can only have one live endpoint at a time. That means you can’t simultaneously connect to a TCP address and host an app online at the same time in the free plan.


###How does ngrok calculate endpoints for limits?
ngrok uses a combination of unique host:port combinations to calculate endpoints. You cannot have one of more than one of these in use at a time. Unlike other limits, this limit does not refresh at the end of each calendar month, you must simply stop using one endpoint in order to get another. For example, you can not have an open connection to a TCP endpoint if you want to serve your app on foo.ngrok.com. 

##Data Transfer Out
###What is data transfer out?
This is the amount of Outgoing Bandwidth you are transmitting out of your endpoints. Data Transfer Out is measured in bytes and converted to Gigabytes. 

Data Transfer Out does not include incoming bandwidth. That is unlimited. 

Free ngrok users receive 1GB of Data Transfer out per calendar month.

###Where can I view my data transfer out usage?
You can review your data transfer out for the month as well as the remainder amount at dashboard.ngrok.com/usage. 

###When do data transfer/bandwidth limits refresh?
Limits refresh every calendar month. This means you start at zero on the first of each month. 


##Requests
###What are requests?
A request is made by a client, to a named host, which is located on a server. Requests are made to HTTP and HTTPS endpoints. 

Requests do not include connections made to TLS and TCP Endpoints. 

Free ngrok users receive 10,000 requests per month. 

###Where can I view my requests usage?
You can review your requests for the month as well as the remainder amount at dashboard.ngrok.com/usage. 

###When do request limits refresh?
Limits refresh every calendar month. This means you start at zero on the first of each month.
