# Migrate from ngrok Endpoint Configurations to Cloud Endpoints

This guide walks you through manually migrating **ngrok endpoint configurations** to **cloud endpoints** with appropriate **traffic policies**.

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

- An **ngrok account** with an **ngrok API token**.
- The [ngrok API documentation](https://ngrok.com/docs/api).
- Tools like `curl` or Postman (or ngrok's own API libraries).
- Understanding of your existing **endpoint configurations**.
- YAML formatting skills for creating traffic policies.
- A text editor to prepare YAML payloads.

## ⚙️ Step 1: Set Up Environment

Make sure you have:

- **NGROK_API_TOKEN** (your personal or organization token).
- **API Base URL**: `https://api.ngrok.com`.

**Example Header for all API requests:**

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_NGROK_API_TOKEN
Ngrok-Version: 2
Content-Type: application/json

```

## 🔎 Step 2: Retrieve Existing Endpoint Configurations

Get a list of all current endpoint configurations:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_NGROK_API_TOKEN" \
     -H "Ngrok-Version: 2" \
     https://api.ngrok.com/endpoint_configurations

```

Save the response. Each object represents an existing endpoint you may need to migrate.

## 🗂️ Step 3: Retrieve Reserved Domains and Addresses

You must associate reserved domains and addresses with endpoint configurations manually.

**Reserved Domains (HTTP / HTTPS):**

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_NGROK_API_TOKEN" \
     -H "Ngrok-Version: 2" \
     https://api.ngrok.com/reserved_domains

```

**Reserved Addresses (TCP):**

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_NGROK_API_TOKEN" \
     -H "Ngrok-Version: 2" \
     https://api.ngrok.com/reserved_addrs

```

**Match reserved domains/addresses** to endpoint configurations:

- For **domains**, check if `http_endpoint_configuration` or `https_endpoint_configuration` is populated.
- For **addresses**, check if `endpoint_configuration` is populated.

## 🛠️ Step 4: Build a Traffic Policy for Each Endpoint

For each endpoint configuration:

1. **Analyze Features** enabled on the endpoint:
    - OAuth? OIDC? Webhook verification? TLS termination?
    - Request/response header modifications?
    - IP restrictions?
    - Circuit breaker or compression?
2. **Translate Module Configuration to Traffic Policy YAML**.
    
    [📚 Guide: How to Migrate Each Endpoint Configuration Module to Traffic Policy Actions](/docs/guides/migration/modules-to-traffic-policy-actions)
    

To help start you off, here is a **basic Traffic Policy skeleton in YAML**:

```yaml
on_http_request: []
on_http_response: []
on_tcp_connect: []
```

## ✍️ Step 5: Create a New Cloud Endpoint

Once your traffic policy YAML is ready:

Create a new **cloud endpoint**:

```bash
curl -X POST \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_NGROK_API_TOKEN" \
     -H "Ngrok-Version: 2" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "description": "Migrated from endpoint configuration ID",
           "type": "cloud",
           "url": "<address or domain>",
           "traffic_policy": "--- YOUR POLICY YAML STRINGIFIED HERE ---"
         }' \
     https://api.ngrok.com/endpoints

```

Make sure:

- `url` matches the domain or address associated with the old configuration.
- `traffic_policy` is stringified and properly escaped, using third-party tools can help with this.

---

## 🗑️ Step 6: Delete the Old Endpoint Configuration

Once the new endpoint is verified to work:

```bash
curl -X DELETE \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_NGROK_API_TOKEN" \
     -H "Ngrok-Version: 2" \
     https://api.ngrok.com/endpoint_configurations/YOUR_ENDPOINT_CONFIG_ID
```

---

## 🔁 Repeat for All Endpoint Configurations

- Repeat **Steps 2–6** for every domain and address you have attached to the endpoint config.
- Be careful if endpoints have multiple domains/addresses attached.

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Dry Run First**: Test traffic policies without deleting anything.
- **Backup Everything**: Save JSON exports of your current configurations.
- **Check your protocols!** Not everything is supported on TCP / TLS!

---

# ✅ You're Done!

After completing the process, your endpoints will be managed under **cloud endpoints** with fine-grained **traffic policies**, allowing better modular management and control.
