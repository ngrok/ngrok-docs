title: Load Balancing Between Multiple Clouds
description: Learn how to load balance traffic between multiple clouds with ngrok.
---

When you load-balance within a single cloud, you can often get away with using
that cloud provider's built-in solutions, like AWS Elastic Load Balancing for
just one example. But once you start deploying replicas of your services to
multiple clouds, you need a load balancer that's multicloud-ready.

[Endpoint Pooling](/docs/universal-gateway/endpoint-pooling) makes multicloud
load balancing as simple as creating two endpoints with the same URL. ngrok then
automatically distributes traffic to replicas in multiple clouds, which means
you don't need other load balancers in your stack. Plus, endpoint
pooling:

- Works with the [agent CLI](/docs/agent),
  [SDKs](/docs/agent-sdks/) and our [Kubernetes Operator](/docs/k8s). You can
  even use all these tools in a single pool.
- Lets you migrate from one deployment strategy to another without hard
  cut-overs, like moving from using the agent for ingress to embedding ngrok
  directly in your app/API with an SDK.
- Works with [Traffic Policy](/docs/traffic-policy), enabling you to manage
  traffic identically across all your replicas from a single "front door", or
  enforce different policies for each replica.

This guide will show you how to set up endpoint pooling with a few different
methods.

## Using the CLI

Start with a single [agent
endpoint](/docs//docs/universal-gateway/agent-endpoints/) on an ngrok URL (or a
[custom domain](/docs/guides/other-guides/how-to-set-up-a-custom-domain/)!), and
the `--pooling-enabled` flag on.

```bash mode="cli"
ngrok http 8000 --url https://$YOUR_DOMAIN.ngrok.app --pooling-enabled true
```

Repeat the same steps on another cloud where you've deployed a replica of your
service to start a second internal agent endpoint on the same URL.

```bash mode="cli"
ngrok http 8000 --url https://$YOUR_DOMAIN.ngrok.app --pooling-enabled true
```

You're now pooling! Send a few requests with `curl
https://$YOUR_DOMAIN.ngrok.app` to see responses balanced between those two
endpoints, even though they're running in multiple clouds.

You can verify pooling works in a few ways:

1. Check each agent's UI in the terminal that launched the process. You should
   see your curl requests in the number of recent requests.
2. In [Traffic Inspector](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/traffic-inspector)—click
   on a request, then the **Response** tab, and look at **Ngrok-Agent-Ips** to see
   the IP for the responding agent changes from request to request with a similar
   frequency.

## Using SDKs and other tools

Pooling isn't limited to how you start a given service or its replicas. If
you've already started up one agent endpoint with the CLI, you can start up
another with one of our [SDKs](/docs/agent-sdks) or the [Kubernetes
Operator](/docs/k8s) to load-balance between them.

Here's an example of a Go app with the [ngrok Go
SDK](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-go). Just as with the agent CLI examples in
the previous step, this Go app starts up an agent endpoint at
`$YOUR_DOMAIN.ngrok.app` with pooling enabled.

To try this example, save the following file as `main.go`.

```go title="main.go"
package main

import (
  "context"
  "fmt"
  "log"
  "net/http"

  "golang.ngrok.com/ngrok"
  "golang.ngrok.com/ngrok/config"
)

func main() {
  if err := run(context.Background()); err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }
}

func run(ctx context.Context) error {
  listener, err := ngrok.Listen(ctx,
    config.HTTPEndpoint(
      config.WithDomain("$YOUR_DOMAIN.ngrok.app"),
      config.WithPoolingEnabled(true),
    ),
    ngrok.WithAuthtokenFromEnv(),
  )
  if err != nil {
    return err
  }

  log.Println("App URL", listener.URL())
  return http.Serve(listener, http.HandlerFunc(handler))
}

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  fmt.Fprintln(w, "<h1>Hello from ngrok-go!</h1>")
}
```

Then, initialize the dependencies.

```bash mode="cli"
go mod init ngrok-go-example
go get golang.ngrok.com/ngrok
```

Finally, start your app to fire up the ngrok Go SDK and add a new agent endpoint
to your pool.

```bash mode="cli"
NGROK_AUTHTOKEN="<TOKEN>" go run main.go
```

If you already have a pool of endpoints created by agent CLIs, make a few more
requests to see responses from your Go app despite these services operating in
entirely different clouds and deployment environments.

## Using Endpoint POoling with Cloud Endpoints for custom traffic management

Pooling also works with [internal](/docs/universal-gateway/internal-endpoints/)
Agent Endpoints, which can only receive traffic from the [`forward-internal`
Traffic Policy action](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/forward-internal/) attached
to another endpoint created by your ngrok account.

When you pair a pool of internal agent endpoints with a [Cloud
Endpoint](/docs/universal-gateway/cloud-endpoints/), you have a single "front
door" for your multicloud load-balanced services. That also lets you add traffic
management fundamentals, like authentication, URL rewrites/redirects, or header
manipulation, across all your replicas from one place.

If you want to create your cloud endpoint on the same URL
(`$YOUR_DOMAIN.ngrok.app`), then you'll need to first stop any agents you've
already created on that URL in the first two steps and recreate them on an
internal URL, which ends with `.internal`, like `https://pooling.internal`.

Then jump over to the [**Endpoint**
section](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/endpoints) of your ngrok dashboard. Click
**New**, then **Cloud Endpoint**. Leave the binding as **Public**, enter
`$YOUR_DOMAIN.ngrok.app` for the domain, and click **Create Cloud Endpoint**.

You then need to apply a Traffic Policy and the `forward-internal` action—the
policy below does one important thing: Route all requests to your pool of
internal agent endpoints.

```yaml
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: https://pooling.internal
```

Paste the above YAML into the dashboard and click **Save**.

Now when you request `https://$YOUR_DOMAIN.ngrok.app`, your traffic is first
routed through the cloud endpoint before being shared among your pooled internal
agent endpoints.

:::info Coming soon!

Custom load balancing strategies are not yet generally available, but you can
request early access to the developer preview in your [ngrok
dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/developer-preview).

With custom load balancing strategies, you'll be able to decide exactly what
happens to load-balanced traffic in certain scenarios, like:

- Balance randomly among endpoints in a single cloud provider, then fall back to
  a secondary cloud if they all become unavailable.
- Prioritize endpoints with the most memory regardless of which cloud they were
  deployed from.
- Route traffic to specific cloud providers depending on where the request
  originated from.

## What's next?

If you opted for a Cloud Endpoint that routes traffic to a pool of internal
Agent Endpoints, you can now filter, manage, and orchestrate traffic from that
single endpoint using Traffic Policy. Here's a few of our most popular actions:

- [`oauth`](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/oauth)
- [`url-redirect`](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/url-redirect)
- [`set-vars`](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/set-vars)
- [`add-headers`](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/add-headers)

We didn't cover Kubernetes deployments in this guide, but we have a similar
quickstart guide for [load-balancing K8s
services](/docs/guides/other-guides/load-balancing-kubernetes.mdx). If you're
interested in a more production-ready deployment, take a look at our [multicloud
API gateway setup tutorial](/docs/guides/api-gateway/multicloud).
