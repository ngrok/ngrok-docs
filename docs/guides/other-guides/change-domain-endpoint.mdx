If you want to change the domain that your active endpoint is using, you have come to the right place.
This short guide will walk you through how to replace the domain your endpoint uses without causing any downtime to your services! 

## Prerequisites
1. An ngrok API Key
2. Active Cloud and Agent internal endpoints

## Step 1 - Setup your API Key

1. Generate an API Key from the ngrok dashboard [here](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/api-keys)
2. Add the API Key to your ngrok config file by running: 
````ngrok config add-api-key YOUR_API_KEY````
3. Verify that the API Key is set by running: 
````ngrok config check````
4. You should see the API Key listed in the output.

## Step 2 - Get the ID of the endpoint you want to modify

1. List all your endpoints by running:
````ngrok api endpoints list````
2. Find the endpoint you want to modify and note its ID. You can also do this from the dashboard from the Endpoints page [here](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/endpoints).
3. The ID will look something like this: `ep_1234567890abcdef`.

## Step 3 - Reserve a new Domain or Use an Existing Domain
You can either reserve a new domain or use an existing one by seeing what reserved domains you have available [here](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains).

## Step 4 - Update the Endpoint with the New Domain
Now you can run the following to change the URL of your cloud endpoint:

```ngrok api endpoints update ep_<YOUR_ENDPOINT_ID> --url=<RESERVED_DOMAIN_URL>```

## Step 5 - Verify the Change
To verify that the change was successful, you can run:

```ngrok api endpoints get ep_<YOUR_ENDPOINT_ID>```

You should see the new URL in the output.

Congratulations! You have now successfully changed the domain of your Cloud Endpoint without any downtime.
