[n8n allows you to self-host](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/), which is great when you're testing workflows; but when you're ready to turn your instance into a production-ready automation and don't want to buy a domain or pay for hosting, you might feel lost.

This guide walks you through how to get your self-hosted n8n instance running in Docker live on the internet. We'll show you how to set up ngrok with Docker or or with the agent CLI, get your static domain, and protect your endpoint, all for free with ngrok.

## Set up your local server with n8n

Follow the steps listed in [n8n's docs](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/docker/) to self-host n8n in Docker.

### 1. Connect ngrok to your account

Sign up for an account at [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/) and [get your auth token](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).

### 2. Install ngrok

<Tabs groupId="user-type" queryString="user-type">
<TabItem value="Docker" label="Docker" default>

Install ngrok via Docker with the following command:

```bash
docker pull ngrok/ngrok
```

Run ngrok via Docker:

```bash
docker run -it -e NGROK_AUTHTOKEN=<token> ngrok/ngrok http 80
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="CLI" label="CLI">
[Download and install](https://ngrok.com/download) the ngrok CLI. Then connect ngrok to your account by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 3. Claim your free static domain

Claim your free static domain [in the dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains). It should look something like `happy-rabbit-partially.ngrok.free.app`.

Copy this domain to use in the next step.

### 4. Launch a new container in Docker

Launch a new container in Docker with updated environment variables including your ngrok domain.

- Create a new container in Docker, and assign it to port `5678`.
  :::tip
  Reuse the same volume or bind mount for the data folder in your old n8n container. The host path must stay the same. This will ensure that your n8n workflows, credentials, or execution history are not impacted.
  :::
- Create two environment variables, pasting in your ngrok URL as the value, and making sure it starts with `https://`.

```bash
export N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL=<your_static_domain_here>
export WEBHOOK_URL=<your_webhook_url_here>
```

- Lastly, add the following environment variable:

```bash
export N8N-DEFAULT_BINARY_DATA_MODE=filesystem
```

When you set the value to filesystem, n8n saves large files as binary data during workflow runs so your processes executes quickly.

Once this is done and the new container with your ngrok domain is launched:

1. Delete the old container
1. Hit the run button to create your new container running on ngrok

### 5. Test your integration

Open `http://localhost:5678` and log in with your credentials. You should see everything you had locally.

### 6. Expose your server with ngrok

Start an endpoint at your app's port:

```bash
ngrok http 5678 --url https://<your_static_domain_here>
```

Navigate to your ngrok domain. You should be able to access it from anywhere now.

## Example use case

This example will teach you how to limit access to your n8n server from IPs associated with Tor exit nodes using ngrok's [Traffic Policy](/docs/traffic-policy/) and [IP Intel](/docs/traffic-policy/variables/ip-intel/).

### 1. Create a Traffic Policy

Locally, save this file as `policy.yml`:

```bash
on_http_request:
  - expressions:
    - "('proxy.anonymous.tor' in conn.client_ip.categories)"
  - actions:
      - type: deny
```

### 2. Restart the agent

Restart your ngrok agent with the `--traffic-policy-file` argument.

```bash
ngrok http 5678 --url https://<your_static_domain_here> --traffic-policy-file policy.yml
```
