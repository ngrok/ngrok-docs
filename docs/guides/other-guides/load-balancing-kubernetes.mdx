A core benefit of Kubernetes is that it simplifies creating multiple replica
pods for your apps or APIs and automatically load-balancing
between them. That's helpful if you have a single cluster and need to
horizontally scale, but Kubernetes can't help if you want:

- Share traffic between multiple clusters.
- Balance traffic between more than one cloud providers.
- Deploy canary versions or run A/B tests of your apps/APIs on a single cluster.

[Endpoint Pooling](/docs/universal-gateway/endpoint-pooling/) makes load
balancing between Kubernetes services simple—you only need to create two
endpoints with the same URL. Here's how that works in your clusters, whether
you're using our `AgentEndpoint` custom resource,
[Ingress](/docs/k8s/guides/using-ingresses) objects, or [Gateway
API](/docs/k8s/guides/using-gwapi) resources.

## 1. Install the ngrok Kubernetes Operator

Check out our [installation instructions](/docs/k8s/installation/install/) for
details on how to use Helm to deploy the open-source Operator to each cluster
you'd like to load-balance between.

## 2. Create your first Agent Endpoint

Pooling is always enabled on `AgentEndpoint` resources, but with Ingress or
Gateway API, you have to enable it with an annotation.

The YAML snippets below are just illustrations—you'll also need change the
details of your services, like their names, ports, and namespaces, to match what
you've already implemented. Same goes for `$NGROK_DOMAIN`—you can reserve a domain in
the [dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains) if you don't have one already.

<Tabs groupId="k8s" queryString="k8s">
	<TabItem value="AgentEndpoint" label="Agent Endpoint" default>
	```yaml
		apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
		kind: AgentEndpoint
		metadata:
			name: example
			namespace: default
		spec:
			upstream:
				url: http://example.default:80
			url: https://$NGROK_DOMAIN
	```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="Ingress" label="Ingress" default>
	```yaml
	apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
	kind: Ingress
	metadata:
		name: example-ingress
		namespace: default
		annotations:
			k8s.ngrok.com/pooling-enabled: "true"
	spec:
		ingressClassName: ngrok
		rules:
			- host: $NGROK_DOMAIN
				http:
					paths:
						- path: /
							pathType: Prefix
							backend:
								service:
									name: example
									port:
										number: 80
	```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="GWAPI" label="Gateway API" default>
	```yaml
	apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
	kind: Gateway
	metadata:
		name: ngrok-gateway
		namespace: default
		annotations:
		  k8s.ngrok.com/pooling-enabled: "true"
	spec:
		gatewayClassName: ngrok
		listeners:
			- name: example-hostname
				protocol: HTTP
				port: 80
				hostname: $NGROK_DOMAIN
	---
	apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
	kind: HTTPRoute
	metadata:
		name: example-route
		namespace: default
	spec:
		parentRefs:
		  - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
			  kind: Gateway
		    name: ngrok-gateway
		    namespace: default
		hostnames:
		  - $NGROK_DOMAIN
		rules:
		  - matches:
			  - path:
					  type: PathPrefix
					  value: /
			backendRefs:
			  - name: example
				  port: 80
	```
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## 3. Create a second Agent Endpoint to enable pooling

On a second cluster, apply the same or similar ingress configuration—just
make sure the `url`, `host`, or `hostname` value is the same for
`AgentEndpoint`, Ingress, and Gateway API implementations, respectively.

Hit your endpoint a few times to get responses from multiple clusters.

## What's next?

Now that you're load-balancing in Kubernetes, you can repeat the process in
other clusters or clouds to add many other agent endpoints to the pool—there's
no limit on how many services can share traffic on a single URL.

You might also consider creating a single [Cloud
Endpoint](/docs/universal-gateway/cloud-endpoints/) that serves as the "front
door" to all your Kubernetes services, then create a pool of [internal Agent
Endpoints](/docs/universal-gateway/internal-endpoints/) on a pooled URL like
`https://example.internal`.
