[Claude.ai](https://www.anthropic.com/news/introducing-claude) supports [Custom MCP (Messages Control Protocol) Integrations](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/11175166-about-custom-integrations-using-remote-mcp) — allowing it to interact with your own tools and APIs via structured function calls.

That means you can bring any custom MCP server into Claude.ai or Claude Desktop — as long as it's reachable via a public endpoint.

Some of the smartest folks on the internet are already using ngrok to do this in seconds.

## Set up your local server with ngrok for MCP

Follow these steps to quickly test your local MCP server with Claude's MCP integrations:

### 1. Install ngrok

[Download and install](https://ngrok.com/download) the ngrok CLI.

**For macOS:**

```jsx
brew install ngrok
```

### 2. Connect ngrok to your account

Sign up for an account at [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/) and run:

```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN
```

### 3. Start your local MCP server

Make sure your MCP server is running on a specific port:

```bash
$ python mcp-server.py        # or whatever command runs your app

MCP Server Started. Now running on:

  http://localhost:3000
```
:::note
See [the Claude MCP](https://www.claudemcp.com/docs) documentation for more information on how to set up your local server.
:::

### 4. Expose your server with ngrok

Start a tunnel to your app's port:

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

Copy the HTTPS forwarding URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`) which we will use in the next step.

:::tip Get a static URL
Want a URL that doesn't change every time you restart the agent? Claim a [**free static ngrok URL**](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains).

Once you have claimed your free static domain, add the `--url https://<your_static_domain_here>` flag when running the agent.

### 5. Register your ngrok URL

Custom integrations using **Remote MCP** are now available on [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai/) and the Claude Desktop app for users on **Claude Max**, **Team**, and **Enterprise** plans. **This feature is currently in beta.**

<Tabs groupId="user-type" queryString="user-type">
<TabItem value="claude-max" label="Claude Max" default>

1. Go to [**Settings → Profile**](https://claude.ai/settings/profile)
2. Scroll to the **Integrations** section
3. Click **Add more**
4. Paste the MCP server URL from your earlier step
5. Click **Add** to finish setting up the integration

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### 6. Test your integration

Send a message that requires MCP usage through Claude, you should now see requests live through ngrok to your locally running MCP server.

You'll see requests hitting your local server via ngrok.

## Restrict access to only Claude

Let's limit access to your MCP server only to Claude by only allowing the Anthropic IPs. 

### 1. Create a Traffic Policy

Locally, save this file as `policy.yml`:

```bash
on_tcp_connect:
  - actions:
    - type: restrict-ips
      config:
        allow:
          - "160.79.104.0/23"
          - "2607:6bc0::/48"
```

### 2. Restart the agent

Then, restart your ngrok agent, but this time use:

```bash
ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file policy.yml
```

## Done!

Your MCP server is now locked down to only accept requests from Anthropic's IP range.

While this significantly reduces risk, remember: **anyone with the URL can still add it to their account**, so be mindful of where and how you share it.
