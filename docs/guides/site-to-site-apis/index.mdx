This guide provides step-by-step instructions for using ngrok for site-to-site connectivity.
This example shows you how to run the ngrok agent at an external site to get access
to locally running APIs.

The connection will be unencrypted. ngrok recommends [configuring end-to-end encryption with mTLS](/guides/site-to-site-apis-mtls/).
However, we understand there are times when you may
wish to configure an unencrypted connection such as during testing or proof of concept. Therefore, we provide the
steps in this guide, but we recommend configuring mTLS before going to production.

## Install the ngrok agent

[Download](https://ngrok.com/download) the appropriate version and install it on the same subnet as the
APIs you want to access.

## Get an ngrok API Key

[Create an ngrok API key](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/api/new) using the ngrok dashboard.
Make sure you save the API key before you leave the screen because it won't be displayed again.

## Configure a custom agent ingress address

Configuring a [custom agent ingress address](/agent/ingress/) allows you to provide your customers with
a dedicated URL to connect to the ngrok platform. Since your customers will connect using your subdomain,
they can safely block other ngrok domains to control the tunnels started in their network. You'll provide a
subdomain you own, such as `connect.{YOUR_DOMAIN}`, and delegate DNS (Domain Name Service) control of
that subdomain to ngrok.

### Create the agent ingress address

Use the ngrok API to create the custom agent address by running the command below,
substituting your own values for the variables:

```curl
curl \
-X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Ngrok-Version: 2" \
-d '{"description":"{DESCRIPTION}","domain": “connect.{YOUR_DOMAIN}”}' \
https://api.ngrok.com/agent_ingresses

```

You should receive a `201` response similar to the following:

```json
{
	"id": "agin_2esRkfoq4frGvOVUmfhytlr2zS3",
	"uri": "/agent_ingresses/agin_2esRkfoq4frGvOVUmfhytlr2zS3",
	"description": "Custom ingress address for site-to-site connectivity",
	"domain": "connect.configurable-domain.com",
	"ns_targets": [
		"ns-1329.awsdns-38.org",
		"ns-737.awsdns-28.net",
		"ns-1940.awsdns-50.co.uk",
		"ns-427.awsdns-53.com"
	],
	"region_domains": [
		"tunnel.us.connect.configurable-domain.com",
		"tunnel.us-cal-1.connect.configurable-domain.com",
		"tunnel.eu.connect.configurable-domain.com",
		"tunnel.au.connect.configurable-domain.com",
		"tunnel.ap.connect.configurable-domain.com",
		"tunnel.jp.connect.configurable-domain.com",
		"tunnel.sa.connect.configurable-domain.com",
		"tunnel.in.connect.configurable-domain.com"
	],
	"created_at": "2024-04-09T19:37:23Z",
	"certificate_management_policy": null,
	"certificate_management_status": null
}
```

Save the values from the `ns_targets` property and the `region_domains`
property as you'll use them later.

### Update your DNS

Create an `NS` record in your DNS provider's registry for each `ns_targets` value from the
response above, using `connect` as the name for each entry. The screenshot is from AWS Route53, but
you can use any DNS provider you choose.

![alt-text](img/connect-NS.png)

You should have four new records when you’re done.

![alt-text](img/NS.png)

You can run the following command to get the values you need if you didn't save the response.

```curlcurl \
-X GET \
-H "Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}" \
-H "Ngrok-Version: 2" \
https://api.ngrok.com/agent_ingresses
```

## Create a custom wildcard domain

Next, create a custom [wildcard domain](/docs/network-edge/domains-and-tcp-addresses/#wildcard-domains), which will allow you to
create endpoints and receive traffic on any subdomain of your domain.

For example, you might create `*.customer1.{YOUR_DOMAIN}`. You would then be able to create endpoints
on `app.customer1.{YOUR_DOMAIN}` and `dev.customer1.{YOUR_DOMAIN}`. It can be helpful to create
a separate subdomain for each customer site you wish to connect to.

Run the following command, substituting your API key for `{API_KEY}` and your domain for `{YOUR_DOMAIN}`:

```curl
curl \
-X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Ngrok-Version: 2" \
-d '{"domain":"*.customer1.{YOUR_DOMAIN}","region":"us"}' \
https://api.ngrok.com/reserved_domains
```

You should receive a `201` response similar to the following:

```json
{
	"id": "rd_2euR3S7Mt07gRC6NlVGcXtghElK",
	"uri": "https://api.ngrok.com/reserved_domains/rd_2euR3S7Mt07gRC6NlVGcXtghElK",
	"created_at": "2024-04-10T12:31:16Z",
	"domain": "*.customer1.configurable-domain.com",
	"region": "",
	"cname_target": "hn9tzsiu5lnlbhcl.4wsgv9l5wfesschhy.ngrok-cname.com",
	"http_endpoint_configuration": null,
	"https_endpoint_configuration": null,
	"certificate": null,
	"certificate_management_policy": {
		"authority": "letsencrypt",
		"private_key_type": "ecdsa"
	},
	"certificate_management_status": {
		"renews_at": null,
		"provisioning_job": {
			"error_code": null,
			"msg": "Managed certificate provisioning in progress.",
			"started_at": "2024-04-10T12:31:16Z",
			"retries_at": null
		}
	},
	"acme_challenge_cname_target": "mpgy8nkj.acme-challenge.ngrok-dns.com"
}
```

You'll need values from the response in the next section.

### Update DNS records

Next, add two `CNAME` records to your DNS provider's registry, providing values from the previous response.

First add a CNAME record for the wildcard subdomain you just created.

![alt-text](img/CNAME.png)

Then add another record for the
[ACME (Automated Certificate Management Environment)](https://venafi.com/blog/what-acme-protocol-and-how-has-it-changed-pki/)
validation. For the record, enter `acme_challenge_cname_target`, and use the value of the  
`acme_challenge_cname_target` property from from previous response for the value.

### Verify DNS

Use the ngrok dashboard to verify that you’ve configured DNS correctly.

1. Login to the [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/).
2. Click **Domains** in the left-hand navigation menu.
3. Click on your wildcard domain under _Domain_.
4. Click **2 targets** next to _DNS Targets_ in the panel displayed on the right-hand side of the screen,
   as denoted by the arrow in the screenshot below.

![alt-text](img/2tunnels.png)

5. Click **Check Status**, as denoted by the arrow in the screenshot below.

![alt-text](img/check-status.png)

6. You should see a successful response similar to the screenshot below.

![alt-text](img/dns-success.png)

## Create a bot user

Now, you’ll create a bot user so that in the next section, you can create an agent authtoken independent of any user account. Recall from Chapter 2 that a bot user does not belong to a particular user account. Run the following command to create a new bot user, providing your API key and a description:

```
curl \
-X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Ngrok-Version: 2" \
-d '{DESCRIPTION}' \
https://api.ngrok.com/bot_users
```

You should receive a 201 response similar to the following:

```json
{
	"id": "bot_2fmwUXhnImKswMgZKCsx7cnbt2l",
	"uri": "https://api.ngrok.com/bot_users/bot_2fmwUXhnImKswMgZKCsx7cnbt2l",
	"name": "new bot user from API",
	"active": true,
	"created_at": "2024-04-29T19:39:36Z"
}
```

## Create the agent authtoken

You should start each agent using a separate authtoken, and that token should belong to a bot user.

To create an authtoken, login to the ngrok dashboard and click [**Authtokens**](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/tunnels/authtokens)
under _Tunnels_, then click **Add a Tunnel Authtoken**.
For **Owner**, select the bot user you use created, and select `bind:*.customer1.{YOUR_DOMAIN}` for the ACL Rules.
This ACL will allow an agent with the authtoken to create tunnels on any subdomain of `customer1.{YOUR_DOMAIN}`.

## Configure the ngrok agent API

You can use the ngrok [agent API](/docs/agent/api/) to start and stop tunnels remotely, collect and replay captured requests,
and collect stats and metrics.

The API runs on `localhost:4040` wherever the agent runs, but you can start an ngrok tunnel to make the API available
remotely.

> **Please note that tunnels started with the agent API do not persist in the event of an agent restart or network outage.**

### Update ngrok.yml

Create a tunnel definition in the ngrok.yml config file. You can then run the ngrok agent and start and
stop tunnels as needed using the ngrok agent API.

You'll need to modify the `ngrok.yml` config file before running the agent. You can modify the file that resides in the default location:

- **Linux:** `~/.config/ngrok/ngrok.yml`
- **MacOS (Darwin):** `~/Library/Application Support/ngrok/ngrok.yml`
- **Windows:** `%HOMEPATH%\AppData\Local\ngrok\ngrok.yml`

Rather than edit the default `ngrok.yml` config file, you can provide your customer with a separate config file.
This keeps your config separate from their existing `ngrok.yml` config file. You can then pass it as an argument when
you run the ngrok agent. ngrok merges all config files, and you won't need to modify your customer's config file.
This is useful when your customer already uses ngrok and you wish to use the existing
agent to serve the ngrok agent API.

Refer to the `region_domain` values you saved when you created the custom agent ingress address.
These are custom addresses for ngrok’s global [Points of Presence (POPs)](http://localhost:3000/docs/network-edge/#points-of-presence).
Support for [Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB)](https://ngrok.com/blog-post/gslb-global-server-load-balancing)
is not yet available when using a custom agent ingress address, so you’ll
need to specify the POP this agent should use to connect to the ngrok platform.

Add the following sections to the `ngrok.yml` config file, substituting the appropriate values for your environment,
including a subdomain to connect to the agent api, such as `agent.customer1.configurable-domain.com`:

```yaml
#config.yml

version: "2"
authtoken: { YOUR_AUTHTOKEN_WITH_ACL }
server_addr: { VALUE_FROM_REGION_DOMAINS }

tunnels:
  agent-api:
    proto: http
    domain: agent.customer1.{ YOUR_DOMAIN }
    addr: 4040
    inspect: false
```

### Start the agent to access the agent API

Now that you’ve updated the `ngrok.yml` config file, start the tunnel for the agent API by running the following
command wherever you installed the agent:

`ngrok start agent-api`

Note that “agent-api” is the name given to the tunnel in the `ngrok.yml` example config file. You can use any descriptive
name for this tunnel. In this case, you’re starting a tunnel to serve the ngrok agent API on `https://agent.customer1.{YOUR_DOMAIN}`.

If you wish to provide your customer with a custom `ngrok.yml` config file rather than modifying the one in the default
location, as mentioned previously, you can pass the path to the file when you start the tunnel:

`ngrok start agent-api –config /path/to/ngrok.yml`

You can pass multiple paths to config files, and ngrok will merge them before starting.

## Start tunnels in your customer’s network

You now have the ngrok agent running in your customer's environment and can
use the agent API to start and stop the tunnels necessary to access
your customer’s APIs.

To start a tunnel to connect to your customer’s API, run the following command,
substituting the appropriate values for your environment:

```curl
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-X POST https://agent.customer1.{YOUR_DOMAIN}/api/tunnels \
-d '{"name":"EXAMPLE","proto":"http", "addr":"{PORT}", "domain":"api.customer1.{YOUR_DOMAIN}"
```

The example below creates a tunnel on port 3000 and serves it at `api.customer1.configurable-domain.com`.
Because a previous step created the wildcard domain on `*.customer1.configurable-domain.com`, a tunnel can be started on
`api.customer1.configurable-domain.com` without reserving that subdomain.

```curl
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-X POST https://agent.customer1.configurable-domain.com/api/tunnels \
-d '{"name":"EXAMPLE","proto":"http", "addr":"3000", "domain":"api.customer1.configurable-domain.com",}'
```
