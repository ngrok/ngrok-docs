## How it works

ngrok’s plans are designed to suit the use cases of individuals, teams, and organizations using ngrok to create secure ingress for development and production workloads. Each license at ngrok roughly represents a developer using an ngrok agent for building an application. It includes the ability to run an ngrok agent (or use the agent SDKs or Kubernetes Ingress Controller) with a custom domain or TCP Address.

## What's the difference between the usage-based and seat-based plans?

ngrok services are and will always be offered on a limited free tier to the broader community.

Seat-based plans are intended for developers, teams, and organizations using ngrok to test and share their apps publicly.

Usage-based plans are intended for developers who have production workloads and services that they choose to front with ngrok.

For details and to select a different plan, see [ngrok pricing](https://ngrok.com/pricing?ref=docs).

## I hit a limit on my plan. What are my options?

ngrok's [free plans](https://ngrok.com/docs/guides/licensing/#what-do-i-get-for-free-on-ngrok) are generous, but some users on Free and Personal plans will find that they run into limits.

If you run into a limit, you have two options:

- You can wait for your cycle to refresh (limits refresh every 30 days per account)
- Upgrade to a plan with higher limits. If you're using ngrok for testing webhooks, the Pro plan is probably the best fit. If you're using ngrok for production, try the Pay-as-you-go plan.

## What do I pay for in ngrok’s Pay-as-you-go pricing?

On ngrok’s pay-as-you-go plan, you get more features and fewer limits (with the option to pay more for resources) than you would on free or the user-based plans. Please note: Our pay-as-you-go plan does have a minimum of $15 per month, invoiced monthly.
