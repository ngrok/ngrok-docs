# Device Gateway

ngrok allows you to create secure ingress to any app, IoT device, or service without spending hours learning arcane networking technologies.

This section provides getting started guides for adding ngrok to the most popular IoT devices, ensuring the agent runs integrated to your operating system, restricting traffic to trusted origins, and integrating traffic events with your preferred logging tool.
