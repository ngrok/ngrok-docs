# Get started - Deliver and secure APIs in production

You've developed a world-class API, and now you want to make it available for clients to access. This guide takes you from
bringing your API online in one line to configuring an API gateway that simplifies routing, security, contract management,
protocol translation, and more, providing a single point of entry for clients and services accessing your APIs.

## Prerequisites

- [Sign up](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup) for an ngrok account if you don't already have one.
- Deploy our [sample REST API](https://github.com/ngrok-samples/ngrok-rest-api) for testing purposes.
- [Download](https://download.ngrok.com) the appropriate version of the ngrok agent, and install it on the same subnet as the API you wish to manage.
- [Create an ngrok API key](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/api-keys/new) using the ngrok dashboard, and [add it to your agent](/docs/agent/#api-keys).

## Set up sample API

To test the Traffic Policy rules in this guide, you can use [the sample API](https://github.com/ngrok-samples/ngrok-rest-api) to simulate an environment with multiple APIs deployed and managed
independently.

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ngrok-samples/ngrok-rest-api.git
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the application on the default port (`8001`):

```bash
npm run start
```

Locate `src/index.js`, and modify the `PORT` value to `8002`:

```js
const PORT = 8001; // Change to 8002
app.listen(PORT, () => {
	console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

Start a second instance:

```bash
npm run start
```

### Create an internal endpoint

Create an internal endpoint for one of the instances of the API by running the following command:

```bash
ngrok http 8001 --url=https://api.internal
```

## Reserve a domain

Run the following command to reserve an ngrok domain, such as `mydomain.ngrok.app`:

```bash
ngrok api reserved-domains create --domain {YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN}
```

This example uses an
[ngrok-managed domain](/docs/network-edge/domains-and-tcp-addresses/#ngrok-managed-domains), but you can use
your own [branded domain](/docs/network-edge/domains-and-tcp-addresses/#branded-domains) when you're ready for production.
In that case, substitute your branded domain for `{YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN}` in the command above, and
[follow the steps](/docs/guides/other-guides/how-to-set-up-a-custom-domain/#create-cname-record-in-domain-dns)
to configure DNS.

If the domain you chose is already in use, you'll get a `400` error with a message to that effect. In that case, run the
command again with a different domain. Alternatively, you can reserve the domain through [the dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains/new),
which will show you which domains are available as you type.

## Bring your API online

You've created an internal endpoint to one of the instances of your API, but you need a cloud endpoint to receive traffic and apply policies before
forwarding requests to your backend service via the internal endpoints. You'll start by bringing one of the instances online.

### Create a Traffic Policy file

Unlike other endpoint types, cloud endpoints _must_ contain at least one traffic policy rule which specifies a `forward-internal` action
and the URL to an internal endpoint where traffic should be forwarded.

Create a file called `policies.yaml` and paste the following contents:

```bash
---
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: https://api.internal
          binding: internal
```

### Create a cloud endpoint

Run the following command from the same directory where you created `policies.yaml` to create a cloud endpoint, substituting the
domain (i.e. `mydomain.ngrok.app`) you reserved in the previous step for `{YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN}`:

```bash
ngrok api endpoints create \
    --bindings public \
    --url https://{YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN} \
    --traffic-policy "$(cat policies.yaml)"
```

You'll receive a `201` response similar to the following:

```bash
{
  "bindings": [
    "public"
  ],
  "created_at": "2024-10-25T14:35:28Z",
  "description": "",
  "domain": {
    "id": "rd_2nvupgtpY4RuEPITujbfHpkhxmO",
    "uri": "https://api.ngrok.com/reserved_domains/rd_2nvupgtpY4RuEPITujbfHpkhxmO"
  },
  "hostport": "mydomain.ngrok.app:443",
  "id": "ep_2nvwbSCefcZv0At2ewhzMHPBT3V",
  "metadata": "",
  "proto": "https",
  "public_url": "https://mydomain.ngrok.app",
  "traffic_policy": "{\"on_http_request\":[{\"actions\":[{\"type\":\"forward-internal\",\"config\":{\"url\":\"https://mandy.ngrok.internal\",\"binding\":\"internal\"}}]}]}",
  "type": "cloud",
  "updated_at": "2024-10-25T14:35:28Z",
  "uri": "https://api.ngrok.com/endpoints/ep_2nvwbSCefcZv0At2ewhzMHPBT3V",
  "url": "https://mydomain.ngrok.app"
}
```

Save the value of `id` because you'll need it in a later step.

### Access your API

You can now access the sample API via the domain you reserved above. For example,
you can run the following command to access the `/cards` route:

```bash
curl -X GET https://{YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN}/cards
```

You'll receive a `200` response similar to to the following:

```bash
{
  "cards": [
    {
      "id": "ccof:uIbfJXhXETSP197M3GB",
      "billing_address": {
        "address_line_1": "500 Electric Ave",
        "address_line_2": "Suite 600",
        "locality": "New York",
        "administrative_district_level_1": "NY",
        "postal_code": "10003",
        "country": "US"
      },
      "bin": "411111",
      "card_brand": "VISA",
      "card_type": "CREDIT",
      "cardholder_name": "Amelia Earhart",
      "customer_id": "VDKXEEKPJN48QDG3BGGFAK05P8",
      "enabled": true,
      "exp_month": 11,
      "exp_year": 2018,
      "last_4": "1111",
      "prepaid_type": "NOT_PREPAID",
      "reference_id": "user-id-1",
      "version": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

Stop the agent to remove the internal endpoint you just created.

## Manage APIs with Traffic Policy rules

Your API is now online, but it is completely exposed to the outside world. Next, add some traffic policy rules to authenticate
requests and shape the traffic that reaches your backend service. You'll do this by running a command to update the configuration
of your existing cloud endpoint, so you'll need the `id` from the previous step.

If you didn't save the id when you created
the cloud endpoint, run the following command, locate your endpoint, and grab its `id`:

```
ngrok api endpoints list
```

### Route by headers

You can configure traffic policy rules to direct traffic based on HTTP header values.

#### Start internal endpoints

To implement this example, run each of the following commands in a separate terminal to start internal endpoints to the two instances of the sample API:

```bash
ngrok http 8001 --url=https://v1.api.internal
ngrok http 8002 --url=https://v2.api.internal
```

While these endpoints point to two separate instances of the same backend API, they simulate the scenario where you need to direct traffic to two
separate API services depending on the version.

#### Update your policy rules

This example looks for a header named `X-Api-Version` and routes traffic to different instances of the `/cards` route of the sample API.
Feel free to modify it for your own API if you're not using the sample app. Update your `policies.yaml` file with the contents below,
overwriting all previous contents:

```yaml
---
on_http_request:
  - name: "Route traffic to API v1"
    expressions:
      - "'1' in req.headers['x-api-version']"
    actions:
      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: https://v1.api.internal
          binding: internal
  - name: "Route traffic to API v2"
    expressions:
      - "'2' in req.headers['x-api-version']"
    actions:
      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: https://v2.api.internal
          binding: internal
  - actions:
      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: https://v2.api.internal
          binding: internal
```

:::note
You must always include the `forward-internal` action as the final step in your policy file since once it executes,
no subsequent policy rules will be executed. Additionally, you always need a terminating policy rule.
In this case, the traffic forwards to `https://v2.api.internal` if the header is set to a value other than `1` or `2` or
if the header isn't present in the request.
:::

Run the following command, substituting your `{ENDPOINT_ID}`, to update the cloud endpoint with the new policy actions:

```bash
 ngrok api endpoints update {ENDPOINT_ID} --traffic-policy "$(cat policies.yaml)"
```

#### Test traffic policies

You can test this by passing a header value when you send a request to this API. Try it with version 1.

```bash
curl -X GET https://{YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN}/cards --header "X-Api-Version: 1"
```

You'll receive a `200` response similar to to the following:

```json
{
	"cards": [
		{
			"id": "ccof:uIbfJXhXETSP197M3GB",
			"billing_address": {
				"address_line_1": "500 Electric Ave",
				"address_line_2": "Suite 600",
				"locality": "New York",
				"administrative_district_level_1": "NY",
				"postal_code": "10003",
				"country": "US"
			},
			"bin": "411111",
			"card_brand": "VISA",
			"card_type": "CREDIT",
			"cardholder_name": "Amelia Earhart",
			"customer_id": "VDKXEEKPJN48QDG3BGGFAK05P8",
			"enabled": true,
			"exp_month": 11,
			"exp_year": 2018,
			"last_4": "1111",
			"prepaid_type": "NOT_PREPAID",
			"reference_id": "user-id-1",
			"version": 1
		}
	]
}
```

Go to the terminal where you started the internal endpoint `https://v1.api.internal` on port `8001`, and you'll see the request hit
the correct endpoint.

```bash
ngrok                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               (Ctrl+C to quit)

```

Change the header value to `2` and run the command again. You'll get the same response, but you should see this request hit the `https://v2.api.internal`
endpoint on port `8002`.

Stop both agent instances to remove the internal endpoints you just created.

### Route by path

Path-based routing enables you to direct traffic to different backend services based on the value of the path.

#### Start internal endpoints

To implement this example, run the following commands in separate terminals to start internal endpoints to the two instances of the sample API:

```bash
ngrok http 8001 --url=https://hostA.api.internal
ngrok http 8002 --url=https://hostB.api.internal
```

While these endpoints point to two separate instances of the same backend API, they simulate the scenario where you need to direct
traffic to two separate API services depending on the path.

#### Update your policy rules

This example routes traffic to two different backends depending on the path. Copy the following contents into your `policy.yaml`
file, overwriting all previous contents:

```yaml
---
on_http_request:
  - name: "Route the /cards/* path to host A"
    expressions:
      - req.url.path.startsWith('/cards')
    actions:
      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: https://hostA.api.internal
  - name: "Route the /payouts/* path to host B"
    expressions:
      - req.url.path.startsWith('/payouts')
    actions:
      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: https://hostB.api.internal
  - actions:
      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: https://hostB.api.internal
          binding: internal
```

:::note
You must always include the `forward-internal` action as the final step in your policy file since once it executes,
no subsequent policy rules will be executed. Additionally, you always need a terminating policy rule.
In this case, the traffic forwards to https://hostB.api.internal if the path begins with a value other than `/cards` or `/payments`.

:::
Now, run the following command to apply the new policies to your cloud endpoint.

```bash
 ngrok api endpoints update {ENDPOINT_ID} --traffic-policy "$(cat policies.yaml)"
```

#### Test traffic policies

Run the following command to hit the `/cards` route:

```bash
curl -X GET https://{YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN}/cards
```

Examine the terminal where you started the `https://hostA.api.internal` endpoint on port `8001`, and you can
see that the request hit the correct endpoint. Repeat the steps for the `/payments` endpoint and confirm the request
was sent to the `https://hostB.api.internal` endpoint on port `8002`.

Stop both agent instances to remove the internal endpoints you just created.

### Configure URL rewrites

The URL Rewrite traffic policy action allows you to modify the incoming request URL using regular expressions before it
reaches the upstream service, without changing the URL seen by the client. This action allows you to route user requests
without exposing internal system details.

#### Start an internal endpoint

Run the following command to start an internal endpoint:

```bash
ngrok http 8001 --url=https://api.internal
```

#### Update your policy rules

These traffic policies allow you to redirect requests sent to the `/credit-cards` route to the `/cards` route
without the client seeing the backend URL. Copy the following contents into your `policy.yaml` file, overwriting all previous contents:

```yaml
---
on_http_request:
  - name: "Route traffic sent to /credit-cards to /cards"
    expressions:
      - "req.url.path == '/credit-cards'"
    actions:
      - type: url-rewrite
        config:
          from: credit-cards
          to: cards
  - actions:
      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: https://api.internal
          binding: internal
```

:::note
You must always include the `forward-internal` action as the final step in your policy file since once it executes,
no subsequent policy rules will be executed. Additionally, you always need a terminating policy rule.
In this case, the traffic forwards to `https://api.internal` if a path other than `/credit-cards` is encountered.
:::

#### Test traffic policies

Run the following command to hit the `/credit-cards` route, which doesn't exist, and confirm that you are redirected
to the `/cards` route instead:

```bash
curl -X GET https://{YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN}/credit-cards
```

Stop the agent to remove the internal endpoint you just created.

### Enable rate limiting

Add rate limiting to your API gateway to ensure your service does not become overwhelmed by too many requests and
that each of your clients has fair access to your API.

#### Start an internal endpoint

Run the following command to start an internal endpoint:

```bash
ngrok http 8001 --url=https://api.internal
```

#### Update your policy rules

This traffic policy rule allows 10 requests over a 60 second window
based on the API key of the client as determined by the value of the HTTP header. You can also limit by
[endpoint](/docs/http/traffic-policy/gallery/#rate-limit-for-specific-endpoint),
[authentication status](/docs/http/traffic-policy/gallery/#rate-limit-api-consumers-based-on-authentication-status),
or [pricing tier](/docs/http/traffic-policy/gallery/#rate-limit-api-consumers-based-on-pricing-tiers).

Copy the following contents into your `policy.yaml` file, overwriting all previous contents:

```yaml
---
on_http_request:
  - name: Add rate limiting
    expressions: []
    actions:
      - type: rate-limit
        config:
          name: Only allow 30 requests per minute
          algorithm: sliding_window
          capacity: 3
          rate: 60s
          bucket_key:
            - req.Headers['x-api-key']
  - actions:
      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: https://api.internal
          binding: internal
```

:::note
You must always include the `forward-internal` action as the final step in your policy file since once it executes,
no subsequent policy rules will be executed.
:::

Run the following command, substituting your `{ENDPOINT_ID}`, to update the cloud endpoint with the new policy actions:

```bash
 ngrok api endpoints update {ENDPOINT_ID} --traffic-policy "$(cat policies.yaml)"
```

#### Test traffic policies

You can test the rate limiting action by running the following command, substituting the appropriate value for `{YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN}`:

```bash
for i in `seq 1 50`; do curl -X GET -w '%{http_code}' https://{YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN}/cards ; done
```

You'll see a response similar to [the first example](/docs/guides/api-gateway/get-started/#test-traffic-policies) until you
hit the rate limit, and then you'll see `429` errors returned.

Stop the agent to remove the internal endpoint you just created.

### Add JWT validation

The JWT validation policy action allows you to integrate your ngrok endpoints with your existing authentication provider. This example provides
step-by-step instructions for integrating with Auth0, but you can configure JWT validation for any OAuth provider. Check
out our [integrations guides](/docs/integrations/) for specific examples.

#### Define your API in Auth0

1. Log in to your [Auth0 Tenant Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard).
1. Select **Applications > APIs**.
1. Click **+ Create API**.
1. Name your API whatever you'd like.
1. Replace `{YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN}` with your ngrok domain for the identifier.
1. Leave the default values for **JSON Web Token (JWT) Profile \*** and **JSON Web Token Signing Algorithm \***.
1. Click **Create**.

<img src={Auth0} alt="Auth0 Create API" style={{width: 600}} />

#### Access your JWT

Upon creating your new API, Auth0 will create an associated application under
**Applications > APIs** in the left navigation bar.

Navigate to your application, and click on the `Test` tab. Here, you will
find a signed, fully functional JWT, as well as examples of how to programmatically
generate one.

![Auth0 Test JWT](img/auth0-test.png)

#### Start an internal endpoint

Run the following command to start an internal endpoint:

```bash
ngrok http 8001 --url=https://api.internal
```

#### Update your policy rules

This traffic policy integrates ngrok with your authentication provider so ngrok can validate JWTs passed in requests to your API.

:::note
You must always include the `forward-internal` action as the final step in your policy file since once it executes,
no subsequent policy rules will be executed.
:::

Copy the following contents into your `policy.yaml` file, overwriting all previous contents:

```yaml
---
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: "jwt-validation"
        config:
          issuer:
            allow_list:
              - value: "https://{YOUR_AUTH0_TENANT_ID}.us.auth0.com/"
          audience:
            allow_list:
              - value: "https://{YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN}"
          http:
            tokens:
              - type: "jwt"
                method: "header"
                name: "Authorization"
                prefix: "Bearer "
          jws:
            allowed_algorithms:
              - "RS256"
            keys:
              sources:
                additional_jkus:
                  - "https://{YOUR_AUTH0_TENANT_ID}.us.auth0.com/.well-known/jwks.json"
  - name: "Forward internal"
    actions:
      - type: "forward-internal"
        config:
          url: "https://api.internal"
          binding: internal
```

#### Test traffic policies

You can test the JWT validation policy by running the following command, substituting your domain for `{YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN}` and
the JWT obtained from the Auth0 dashboard for `{YOUR_JWT}`:

```bash
curl -X GET https://{YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN}/cards \
 --header "Authorization: Bearer {YOUR_JWT}"
```

You'll receive a `200` response with [the same contents as before](/docs/guides/api-gateway/get-started/#test-traffic-policies).

Run the same command, switching out one character of your JWT, and you'll get a `403 Forbidden` error.

Run the command with no `Authorization` header, substituting your domain for `{YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN}`:

```bash
curl -X GET https://{YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN}/cards
```

You'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` error. Your API is now protected from unauthorized requests.

## What's next?

You've successfully brought your API online and protected it with ngrok's API gateway, allowing you to offload non-functional
requirements like rate limiting, authentication, routing, and global load balancing to ngrok. Check out our
[rules gallery](/docs/http/traffic-policy/gallery/) to learn how to extend your traffic policy rules.
