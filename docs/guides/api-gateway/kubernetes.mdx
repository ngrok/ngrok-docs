# Deliver and secure ingress for APIs in Kubernetes

You currently have a K8s cluster with an API (micro)service and want to deliver it
to production with additional features and protection, like rate limiting,
authentication, and DDoS protection.

In this guide, you'll learn how to implement ngrok as an API gateway, using the
ngrok Kubernetes Operator, in these steps:

1. [Apply the ngrok Kubernetes Operator to your cluster](#apply-kubernetes-operator)
2. [Configure your cluster to use ngrok as an API gateway](#configure-cluster-api-gateway)
3. [Set up Traffic Policy to shape traffic into/out of your API service](#set-up-traffic-policy)

## Why use the K8s Gateway API for your API gateway?

Kubernetes has two APIs for handling ingress from external
traffic into your cluster's internal network: the original [Ingress
Controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/)
or the [Gateway
API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/gateway/).

The [ngrok Kubernetes Operator](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator)
supports both mechanisms. While we encourage you to explore both, we recommend
the Gateway API based on the following:

- The [Ingress
  API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/), which
  Ingress Controllers utilize, is frozen in new versions of K8s and no longer
  receives updates.
- While the Ingress Controller is designed purely for ingress, the Gateway API is
  also designed for dynamic infrastructure provisioning and advanced traffic routing.
- The Gateway API is role-oriented, allowing DevOps/platform/infrastructure
  engineering teams to control clusters, policies, and permissions centrally,
  while still allowing API developers to self-service endpoints to their services
  with route objects.
- The Gateway API provides a common interface to K8s networking, removing
  reliance on vendor-specific configurations.
- Many developers can integrate their APIs or apps onto a single `GatewayClass`
  or `Gateway`, using `HTTPRoute`s, without affecting others.

For the scope of this guide, and based on this recommendation, we'll focus on
Gateway API.

## **Step 0**. Deploy the example ngrok API service

If you're building a proof of concept with ngrok as the API gateway for your
APIs in Kubernetes, you can use our [example ngrok API
service](https://github.com/ngrok-samples/ngrok-api-service). This service
responds to all routes with information about the connection&mdash;think of it
as the `pong` to your `curl`.

:::note
If you already have an API service, you can skip this step&mdash;just be aware
that you'll need to edit the example configurations below to properly configure
the ngrok Kubernetes Operator.
:::

To deploy the ngrok API service to your cluster, apply the [`deployment.yaml`
file](https://github.com/ngrok-samples/ngrok-api-service/blob/main/kubernetes/deployment.yaml)
to your cluster, which first creates a new `prod` namespace if one doesn't
already exist.

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngrok-samples/ngrok-api-service/refs/heads/main/kubernetes/deployment.yaml
```

## **Step 1**. Apply the ngrok Kubernetes Operator {#apply-kubernetes-operator}

Add the [ngrok Kubernetes Operator](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator)
repo to Helm.

```bash
helm repo add ngrok https://charts.ngrok.com
helm repo update
```

Apply the latest Gateway API CRDs to your cluster.

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/download/v1.0.0/standard-install.yaml
```

Set up a few environment variables to help apply the ngrok Kubernetes Operator.

- `{AUTHTOKEN}`: An ngrok authtoken&mdash;you can use either your [default
  authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) or [create a
  new authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/authtokens) for this deployment.
- `{API_KEY}`: An API key, created in the [ngrok
  dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/api-keys) to associate with your
  deployment.

```bash
export NGROK_AUTHTOKEN={AUTHTOKEN}
export NGROK_API_KEY={API_KEY}
```

Install the ngrok Kubernetes Operator into a new `ngrok-operator` namespace with
Gateway API functionality enabled.

```bash
helm install ngrok-operator ngrok/ngrok-operator \
  --namespace ngrok-operator \
  --create-namespace \
  --set credentials.apiKey=$NGROK_API_KEY \
  --set credentials.authtoken=$NGROK_AUTHTOKEN \
  --set useExperimentalGatewayApi=true
```

## **Step 2**. Configure your cluster to use ngrok as an API gateway {#configure-cluster-api-gateway}

For ngrok to operate as your API gateway, using the native Gateway API, you need
to configure the following:

- A `GatewayClass` that uses the controller from the ngrok Kubernetes Operator
  project.
- A `Gateway` with at least one `listener` attached to the ngrok domain you
  already reserved.
- At least one `HTTPRoute` in the same namespace as your API service (`prod` in
  our example) that matches specific paths to its `name` and `port`.

### Create the API gateway configuration

Create a new YAML file named `ngrok-api-gateway.yaml` and paste in the following
content.

First, replace `{YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN}` with the domain you reserved.

If you're using the example API service from **Step 0**, substitute
`{YOUR_SERVICE_NAME}` with `ngrok-api-service` and `{SERVICE-PORT}` with `80`.

If you're deploying your own API service, change those variables accordingly, and
edit the `prod` namespace to match the namespace where your service is already
running. If you have multiple API services in different containers, you'll need
to create multiple rules to match paths to services.

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: GatewayClass
metadata:
  name: ngrok-gatewayclass
  namespace: ngrok-operator
spec:
  controllerName: ngrok.com/gateway-controller
---
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: ngrok-gateway
  namespace: ngrok-operator
spec:
  gatewayClassName: ngrok-gatewayclass
  listeners:
    - name: ngrok-listener
      #highlight-start
      hostname: {YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN}
      #highlight-end
      port: 443
      protocol: HTTPS
      allowedRoutes:
        kinds:
          - kind: HTTPRoute
        namespaces:
          from: All
      tls:
        mode: Terminate
        certificateRefs:
          - name: ngrokcert
---
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: ngrok-route
  namespace: prod
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - kind: Gateway
      name: ngrok-gateway
  hostnames:
    #highlight-start
    - {YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN}
    #highlight-end
  rules:
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /
      backendRefs:
        #highlight-start
        - name: {YOUR_SERVICE_NAME}
          port: {SERVICE_PORT}
          #highlight-end
          kind: Service
```

Write the manifest to disk and apply to your cluster.

```bash
kubectl apply -f ngrok-api-gateway.yaml
```

With the ngrok Kubernetes Operator deployed and configured as an API gateway,
your API service is now publicly available at `{YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN}`. You can now
test your API gateway and service.

```bash
curl https://{YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN}
```

You'll see a response like the following:

```bash
{"message":"Pong from ngrok!","host":"{YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN}","client_ip":"{YOUR_IP_ADDRESS}","method":"GET","url":"/","time":"2024-10-16T13:51:37.836Z","status":200}
```

## **Step 3**. Set up Traffic Policy to shape traffic into/out of your API service {#set-up-traffic-policy}

ngrok's [Traffic Policy](/docs/http/traffic-policy/index.mdx) module allows you
to conditionally act upon traffic as it arrives and departs your API gateway. In
a Kubernetes context, Traffic Policy builds on top of the existing YAML
manifests you already use to declare your deployments and services.

When the ngrok Kubernetes Operator initiates in your cluster, and your
`HTTPRoute` configuration contains one or more `filter`
dictionaries that reference the `NgrokTrafficPolicy` CRD, the Operator pipes the
raw YAML to ngrok's network to provision the action and enforce it upon incoming
and outgoing traffic.

Rate limiting&mdash;one of the most in-demand API gateway features&mdash;
is both quick to implement and highly flexible based on your use case.

### Define a rate limiting rule

Create a new YAML file named `ngrok-rate-limit.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
---
kind: NgrokTrafficPolicy
apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
metadata:
  name: rate-limiting
  namespace: prod
spec:
  policy:
    on_http_request:
      - name: "Rate limit POST requests"
        expressions:
          - "req.method == 'POST' || req.method == 'PUT'"
        actions:
          - type: "rate-limit"
            config:
              name: "Only allow 10 requests per minute"
              algorithm: "sliding_window"
              capacity: 10
              rate: "60s"
              bucket_key:
                - "conn.client_ip"
```

This CRD instantiates a rate limiting rule with the following properties:

- Via the `expression`, it only applies to requests with the `POST` or `PUT`
  HTTP method&mdash;all others, like `GET`, are unaffected.
- Allows for a maximum of `10` requests within the last `60s`&mdash;both values
  are configurable to your needs.
- Uses the client's IP address (via the [`conn.client_ip`
  variable](/docs/http/traffic-policy/expressions/variables.mdx#connclient_ip))
  to track usage against your capacity limit.

Check out the [Traffic Policy (for HTTP tunnels)
documentation](/docs/http/traffic-policy/index.mdx) for a complete view
of how to combine variables, expressions, and actions to create rules that
beneficially shape the traffic on your API gateway and lessen the operational
burden on your API service.

### Apply the Traffic Policy rule to your cluster

You must instantiate the `NgrokTrafficPolicy` CRD in your cluster before
you can reference it in your API gateway configuration.

```bash
kubectl apply -f ngrok-rate-limit.yaml
```

### Update your API gateway configuration to include the Traffic Policy rule

With the CRD applied, you need to update your existing configuration
`ngrok-api-gateway.yaml` with a
[filter](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/httproute/#filters-optional),
which is a process that must be completed during the request or response
lifecycle.

Edit your existing `ngrok-api-gateway.yaml` file&mdash;specifically the
`HTTPRoute` section&mdash;to add a reference to the rate limiting policy.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: ngrok-route
  namespace: prod
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - kind: Gateway
      name: ngrok-gateway
  hostnames:
    - {YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN}
  rules:
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /
      backendRefs:
        - name: {YOUR_SERVICE_NAME}
          port: {SERVICE_PORT}
          kind: Service
      #highlight-start
      filters:
        - type: ExtensionRef
          extensionRef:
            group: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com
            kind: NgrokTrafficPolicy
            name: rate-limiting
      #highlight-end
```

Re-apply your manifest to update your API gateway with the new Traffic Policy rule.

```
kubectl apply -f ngrok-api-gateway.yaml
```

### Test the rate limiting rule

Finally, you can validate that your new rate limiting rule was deployed
successfully at the ngrok network by creating a large number of requests in
quick succession.
Run the following on your local workstation, replacing `{YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN}`.

```bash
for i in `seq 1 50`; do curl -X POST -w '%{http_code}' https://{YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN}/ ; done
```

Depending on the `capacity` value you configured in the `NgrokTrafficPolicy`
CRD, you should start seeing `429` response codes shortly.

You can confirm your Traffic Policy rules in the [Edges
section](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/cloud-edge/edges/) of your ngrok dashboard.
Click on the edge associated with this deployment, then one of the routes you
attached your Traffic Policy rule to. Click **Traffic Policy** to view the rule
as run on the ngrok network.

## What's next?

Congratulations&mdash;you've now made your API service available to the public
internet, backed by the power of ngrok operating as an API gateway.

You also already have [HTTP/2](https://ngrok.com/blog-post/http2-support)
enabled by default for all connections that support it. HTTP/2 gives you better
performance with prioritization, multiplexing, and header compression.

Your next best step is to expand your usage of Traffic Policy actions to handle
more advanced API gateway requirements:

- Learn about other ways to configure [Traffic Policy with the Gateway
  API](/docs/k8s/user-guide.mdx#gateway-composition).
- Explore other [Traffic Policy actions](/docs/http/traffic-policy/actions/index.mdx)
  you can enable on your API gateway, like [JWT
  authentication](/docs/http/traffic-policy/actions/jwt-validation.mdx), [adding
  headers](/docs/http/traffic-policy/actions/add-headers.mdx), [URL
  rewrites](/docs/http/traffic-policy/actions/url-rewrite.mdx),
  [logging](/docs/http/traffic-policy/actions/log.mdx), and more.

Finally, you can extend how you use ngrok as an API gateway to better match
your Git-based workflows and using version-controlled, declarative, and
repeatable configurations with a [continuous deployment mechanism like Argo
CD](/docs/integrations/argocd/apiops.mdx).
