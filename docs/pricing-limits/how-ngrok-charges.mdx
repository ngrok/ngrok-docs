| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Concurrent Endpoints Allowance** <br /> Maximum number of endpoints you can run simultaneously.                                                     | Up to 3 endpoints at a time.                                                                                                                                                                  | Up to 3 endpoints at a time.                                                                                                          | No fixed limit (unlimited concurrent endpoints). Each endpoint you run is simply counted toward usage.                                |
| **Active Endpoint Hours** <br /> Counts each hour (clock-hour) in which an endpoint has any outgoing data transfer.                                   | Dev domain endpoints do not accrue billable endpoint hours. Other endpoints consume your one-time free credit; each endpoint with data transfer out in a given hour counts as an active hour. | One named ngrok domain is included without hourly charges. Any additional endpoints (or hours beyond the included domain) are billed. | All endpoints are usage-based. Beyond the baseline, every endpoint that has data transfer out in an hour counts as one hour of usage. |
| **Wildcard Domains** <br /> Reserve a wildcard domain (e.g. `*.example.com`). Each subdomain counts separately.                                       | Not available                                                                                                                                                                                 | Not available                                                                                                                         | Available (by request). Each unique subdomain that receives traffic is billed as its own endpoint.                                    |
| **Endpoint Protocols** <br /> Endpoints use one of the supported protocols (HTTP/S, TCP, TLS), which determine how the endpoint processes connections | HTTP/S, TCP (requires verification), TLS not available.                                                                                                                                       | HTTP/S, TCP, and TLS.                                                                                                                 | HTTP/S, TCP, and TLS.                                                                                                                 |
| **Load Balancing (Endpoint Pooling)** <br /> Combine multiple endpoints to a single domain or address for load balancing.                             | Yes, each endpoint in a pool is treated as a separate endpoint for billing. Regular limits apply.                                                                                             | Yes, each endpoint in a pool is treated as a separate endpoint for billing. Regular limits apply.                                     | Yes; no limit. Each endpoint is billed separately.                                                                                    |
