Learn about the limits enforced in the free ngrok for developers plan.

:::note
The free tier does NOT have timeouts on tunnels. If you'd like to run your endpoint all the time, you can do so, on the free tier, as a [background service](https://ngrok.com/docs/agent/#background-service).
:::

:::tip
See [Pricing and Limits](https://ngrok.com/pricing?ref=docs) to learn how to increase or remove these limits.

## Increasing your limits

If you run into a limit, you can [upgrade to a plan with higher limits](https://ngrok.com/pricing?ref=docs). If you always want your endpoints online and available, select the Pay-as-you-go plan.

See the [Pricing and Limits](/docs/pricing-limits) page for more information.

## Removing the interstitial page

To prevent bad actors from using ngrok to execute [phishing attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing), ngrok [injects an interstitial page](https://ngrok.com/blog-post/fighting-abuse-on-the-ngrok-platform) in front of all HTML browser traffic on the free tier.

- This page informs visitors that they're accessing a site served by ngrok.
- Once the visitor selects the "Visit" button to continue to the site, a cookie is set which prevents the interstitial from appearing for that domain for 7 days.

:::note
This does not impact users serving APIs or accessing ngrok endpoints programmatically.
:::

You can remove the interstitial by upgrading to [any paid plan](https://ngrok.com/pricing?ref=docs-interstitial-removal) or using one of the following methods.

### Using headers

From the client accessing the ngrok endpoint, add a header value of `ngrok-skip-browser-warning` and set it to any value. These requests will bypass the interstitial.

  <Tabs groupId="headers" queryString="library">
    <TabItem value="axios" label="Axios">
      ```js
      axios.get(url, { 'headers': { 'ngrok-skip-browser-warning': '1' } })
        .then((response => {
          console.log(response.data);
        })
        .catch((error) => {
          console.log(error);
        });
      ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="fetch" label="Fetch" default>    
      ```js
      const response = await fetch(URL, {
        headers: {
          "ngrok-skip-browser-warning": "1",
        },
        // ...
      });
      ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="superagent" label="Super Agent" default>
      ```js
      request
            .get('/endpoint')
            .set('ngrok-skip-browser-warning', '1')
            .then(callback);
      ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="jquery" label="JQuery">
      ```js
      request
            .get('/endpoint')
            .set('ngrok-skip-browser-warning', '1')
            .then(callback);
      ```
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

### Using a custom user agent

Change your user agent by setting [the `User-Agent` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent) to something non-standard to bypass the warning, such as `MyApp/0.0.1`.

:::tip
You can also use a browser extension to customize your browser's user agent value. Here is an [example for Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/requestly-intercept-modif/mdnleldcmiljblolnjhpnblkcekpdkpa?hl=en-US).
