# How can I see how my account stacks up against my limits?

The ngrok usage page at dashboard.ngrok.com/usage

# How often do limits refresh?

Your count of resources against a limit refreshes on the first day of each month.

### How does ngrok calculate endpoints for limits?

ngrok uses a combination of unique host:port combinations to calculate endpoints. You cannot have one of more than one of these in use at a time. Unlike other limits, this limit does not refresh at the end of each calendar month, you must simply stop using one endpoint in order to get another.

## Need to Increase your ngrok limits?

Request adjustments to limits that conflict with your project by contacting ngrok. To request an increase to a limit, complete the [Limit Increase Request Form](https://tally.so/r/mKlYOK) and we will reach out with next steps.

## Removing the interstitial warning in front of your HTML content

To prevent bad actors from using ngrok to create phishing pages to steal user credentials, ngrok [injects an interstitial page](https://ngrok.com/blog-post/fighting-abuse-on-the-ngrok-platform) in front of all HTML browser traffic on the free tier. Once the user acknowledges that the site is being served by ngrok, a cookie is set that is valid for 7 days for that domain.

:::note
This does not impact users serving APIs or accessing ngrok endpoints programmatically.
:::

You can remove the interstitial in one of the following ways:

- From the client accessing the ngrok endpoint, add a header value of `ngrok-skip-browser-warning` and set it to any value. These requests will bypass the interstitial.
- Change your user agent by setting the `User-Agent` header to something non-standard, such as `MyApp/0.0.1`, to bypass the warning.
- Upgrade to [any paid plan](https://ngrok.com/pricing?ref=docs).

Axios

```
axios.get(url, { 'headers': { 'ngrok-skip-browser-warning': '1' } })
  .then((response => {
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

Fetch

```
const response = await fetch(URL, {
  headers: {
    "ngrok-skip-browser-warning": "1",
  },
  // ...
});
```

SuperAgent

```
 request
       .get('/endpoint')
       .set('ngrok-skip-browser-warning', '1')
       .then(callback);
```

JQuery

```
 request
       .get('/endpoint')
       .set('ngrok-skip-browser-warning', '1')
       .then(callback);
```

If you are a developer trying to access your own endpoint, you can use a browser extension to customize your browser's user agent value. Here is an [example for Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/requestly-intercept-modif/mdnleldcmiljblolnjhpnblkcekpdkpa?hl=en-US).
