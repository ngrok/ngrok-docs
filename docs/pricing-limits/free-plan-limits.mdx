Learn about the limits enforced in the free ngrok for developers plan.

Note: The free tier does NOT have timeouts on tunnels. That is something that ngrok used to do for anonymous use, but does not do for free accounts. If you'd like to run your tunnel all the time, you can do so, on the free tier, as a [background service.] (https://ngrok.com/docs/agent/#background-service)

:::tip
See [Pricing and Limits](https://ngrok.com/pricing?ref=docs) to learn how to increase or remove these limits.

## Increasing your limits

If you run into a limit, you can:

- Wait for [your limits to refresh](/docs/pricing-limits#refreshing-limits).
- Or, [upgrade to a plan with higher limits](https://ngrok.com/pricing?ref=docs).
  - If you're using ngrok for testing webhooks, consider the Pro plan.
  - If you're using ngrok for production, consider the Pay-as-you-go plan.

See the [Pricing and Limits](/docs/pricing-limits) page for more information.

## Removing the interstitial page

To prevent bad actors from using ngrok to execute [phishing attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing), ngrok [injects an interstitial page](https://ngrok.com/blog-post/fighting-abuse-on-the-ngrok-platform) in front of all HTML browser traffic on the free tier.

- This page informs visitors that they're accessing a site served by ngrok.
- Once the visitor selects the "Visit" button to continue to the site, a cookie is set which prevents the interstitial from appearing for that domain for 7 days.

:::note
This does not impact users serving APIs or accessing ngrok endpoints programmatically.
:::

You can remove the interstitial by upgrading to [any paid plan](https://ngrok.com/pricing?ref=docs-interstitial-removal) or using one of the following methods.

### Using headers

From the client accessing the ngrok endpoint, add a header value of `ngrok-skip-browser-warning` and set it to any value. These requests will bypass the interstitial.

  <Tabs groupId="headers" queryString="library">
    <TabItem value="axios" label="Axios">
      ```js
      axios.get(url, { 'headers': { 'ngrok-skip-browser-warning': '1' } })
        .then((response => {
          console.log(response.data);
        })
        .catch((error) => {
          console.log(error);
        });
      ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="fetch" label="Fetch" default>    
      ```js
      const response = await fetch(URL, {
        headers: {
          "ngrok-skip-browser-warning": "1",
        },
        // ...
      });
      ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="superagent" label="Super Agent" default>
      ```js
      request
            .get('/endpoint')
            .set('ngrok-skip-browser-warning', '1')
            .then(callback);
      ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="jquery" label="JQuery">
      ```js
      request
            .get('/endpoint')
            .set('ngrok-skip-browser-warning', '1')
            .then(callback);
      ```
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

### Using a custom user agent

Change your user agent by setting [the `User-Agent` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent) to something non-standard to bypass the warning, such as `MyApp/0.0.1`.

:::tip
You can also use a browser extension to customize your browser's user agent value. Here is an [example for Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/requestly-intercept-modif/mdnleldcmiljblolnjhpnblkcekpdkpa?hl=en-US).

## I hit a limit on my plan. What are my options?

ngrok's [free plans](/docs/pricing-limits/) are generous, but some users on Free and Personal plans will find that they run into limits.

If you run into a limit, you have two options:

- You can wait for your cycle to refresh on the first day of the next month.
- [Upgrade to a plan with higher limits](https://ngrok.com/pricing). If you're using ngrok for testing webhooks, the Pro plan is probably the best fit. If you're using ngrok for production, try the Pay-as-you-go plan.
