## Removing the interstitial page

To prevent bad actors from using ngrok to create [phishing pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing), ngrok [injects an interstitial page](https://ngrok.com/blog-post/fighting-abuse-on-the-ngrok-platform) in front of all HTML browser traffic on the free tier. Once the user acknowledges that the site is being served by ngrok, a cookie is set that is valid for 7 days for that domain.

:::note
This does not impact users serving APIs or accessing ngrok endpoints programmatically.
:::

You can remove the interstitial by upgrading to [any paid plan](https://ngrok.com/pricing?ref=docs-interstitial-removal) or using one of the following methods.

### Using headers

From the client accessing the ngrok endpoint, add a header value of `ngrok-skip-browser-warning` and set it to any value. These requests will bypass the interstitial.

  <Tabs groupId="headers" queryString="library">
    <TabItem value="axios" label="Axios">
      ```js
      axios.get(url, { 'headers': { 'ngrok-skip-browser-warning': '1' } })
        .then((response => {
          console.log(response.data);
        })
        .catch((error) => {
          console.log(error);
        });
      ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="fetch" label="Fetch" default>    
      ```js
      const response = await fetch(URL, {
        headers: {
          "ngrok-skip-browser-warning": "1",
        },
        // ...
      });
      ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="superagent" label="Super Agent" default>
      ```js
      request
            .get('/endpoint')
            .set('ngrok-skip-browser-warning', '1')
            .then(callback);
      ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="jquery" label="JQuery">
      ```js
      request
            .get('/endpoint')
            .set('ngrok-skip-browser-warning', '1')
            .then(callback);
      ```
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

### Using a custom user agent

Change your user agent by setting the `User-Agent` header to something non-standard, such as `MyApp/0.0.1`, to bypass the warning.
:::tip
You can also use a browser extension to customize your browser's user agent value. Here is an [example for Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/requestly-intercept-modif/mdnleldcmiljblolnjhpnblkcekpdkpa?hl=en-US).

## Increasing your limits

If you run into a limit, you have two options:

- Wait for [your limits to refresh](/docs/pricing-limits#refreshing-limits).
- [Upgrade to a plan with higher limits](https://ngrok.com/pricing?ref=docs).
  - If you're using ngrok for testing webhooks, the Pro plan is probably the best fit.
  - If you're using ngrok for production, try the Pay-as-you-go plan.

See the [Pricing and Limits](/docs/pricing-limits) page for more information.

[^1]: Endpoints are the public URLs that ngrok creates for your tunnels.
