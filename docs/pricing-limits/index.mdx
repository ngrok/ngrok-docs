## General limits

ngrok's plans are designed to suit the use cases of individuals, teams, and organizations using ngrok to create secure ingress for development and production workloads. Each license at ngrok roughly represents a developer using an ngrok agent for building an application. It includes the ability to run an ngrok agent (or use the agent SDKs or ngrok Kubernetes Operator) with a custom domain or TCP Address.

### Resetting limits

Your usage resets on the first day of each month.

### How ngrok calculates endpoints for limits?

ngrok uses a combination of unique host:port combinations to calculate endpoints. You cannot have one of more than one of these in use at a time. Unlike other limits, this limit does not refresh at the end of each calendar month, you must simply stop using one endpoint in order to get another.

## Usage-based vs seat-based plans

- **Seat-based plans** (ngrok for developers) — best for teams, organizations, and developers using ngrok to test and share their apps publicly.
- **Usage-based plans** (ngrok for production) — best for developers who have production workloads and services that they choose to front with ngrok.

For details and to select a plan, see [the pricing page](https://ngrok.com/pricing?ref=docs).
