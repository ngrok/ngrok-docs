:::note
You can check your usage [in the Usage page in the dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/usage).

## General limits

Each license at ngrok roughly represents a developer using an ngrok agent for building an application. It includes the ability to run an ngrok agent (or use the agent SDKs or ngrok Kubernetes Operator) with a custom domain or TCP Address.

### Refreshing limits

Your usage refreshes on the first day of each month.

### Endpoint limits

Your endpoint limit is based on the number of unique host-port combinations you have created. You cannot have more than one of these combinations in use simultaneously.

:::warning
This limit does not refresh at the end of each calendar month.
:::

## Free vs paid plans

- **Free plans** (ngrok for developers) are best for teams, organizations, and developers using ngrok to test and share their apps publicly.
- **Paid plans** (ngrok for production) are best for developers who have production workloads and services that they choose to front with ngrok.

To select a plan, see [the pricing page](https://ngrok.com/pricing?ref=docs).
