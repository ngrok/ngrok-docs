:::note
You can check your usage [in the Usage page in the dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/usage).

## General limits

Each license at ngrok roughly represents a developer using an ngrok agent for building an application. It includes the ability to run an ngrok agent (or use the agent SDKs or ngrok Kubernetes Operator) with a custom domain or TCP Address.

### Refreshing limits

Your usage refreshes on the first day of each month.

### Endpoint limits

Your endpoint limit is based on the number of unique host-port combinations you have created. You cannot have more than one of these combinations in use simultaneously.

:::warning
This limit does not refresh at the end of each calendar month.
:::

## Wildcard and Subdomain Usage

When reserving a wildcard domain on the paid plans, subdomains are counted towards your usage. For example, if you reserve `*.example.com`, `sub1.example.com` and `sub2.example.com` are counted as two subdomains.
You will be charged for each subdomain you use.
You may need to enable overages in order to do this on your paid plan.

## How can I see how my account stacks up against my limits?

[The usage page in the dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/usage).

## What's the difference between the usage-based and free plans?

- **Free plans** (ngrok for developers) are best for teams, organizations, and developers using ngrok to test and share their apps publicly.
- **Paid plans** (ngrok for production) are best for developers who have production workloads and services that they choose to front with ngrok.

To select a plan, see [the pricing page](https://ngrok.com/pricing?ref=docs).

## Pay-as-you-go FAQs

- **What is the Pay-as-you-go plan?**
  - The Pay-as-you-go plan is a flexible pricing model that allows you to pay only for the resources you use, without any upfront commitment. It is ideal for production workloads that require scalability and flexibility.
- **How does the Pay-as-you-go plan work?**
  - You are charged based on your actual usage of ngrok resources, such as data transfer, endpoints, and connections. There are no fixed monthly fees, and you can scale your usage up or down as needed.
- **Why am I seeing two invoices for each billing cycle?**
  - The Pay-as-you-go plan generates two invoices: one for the base fee and another for the usage-based charges. This allows you to see your fixed costs separately from your variable costs.
