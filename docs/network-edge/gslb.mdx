# Global Server Load Balancing

## Overview

Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB) improves the performance and resiliency of
your applications by distributing traffic to the nearest healthy
point of presence, measured by latency, from the perspective of the connecting client. Every
application you deliver with ngrok is automatically accelerated with our
always-on, zero-configuration GSLB.

Conceptually, a GSLB is simple. A GSLB accelerates traffic by adjusting DNS
resolution so that when clients connect to your endpoints on the internet, they
connect to the nearest point of presence (PoP). A GSLB adds resiliency by
adjusting that same DNS resolution process to steer traffic away from failing
PoPs.

## vs. Traditional GSLBs

ngrok operates differently from a traditional GSLB to give you some important
benefits.

1. In a traditional GSLB deployment, you are responsible for running
   geographically redundant copies of your application and configuring networking
   technologies to distribute and failover traffic among these deployments. By
   contrast, ngrok runs a [global delivery network of
   PoPs](/network-edge/#points-of-presence) for you. This means that even if you
   only deploy your upstream service to a single geography, your apps still get
   faster from [Connection Acceleration](#connection-acceleration) and [Module
   Acceleration](#module-acceleration).

2. Unlike a traditional GSLB deployment, when you deploy your application
   services to a new geographic location, ngrok automatically routes nearby
   traffic to those services without any configuration. Traditional GSLB
   deployments require many network configuration updates to bring these new
   locations online like IP provisioning and DNS record changes. With ngrok, there
   is zero configuration, just start your new application services with their
   ngrok agents and you're done.

3. Unlike a traditional reverse proxy, ngrok forwards traffic to your upstream
   services over secure connections established by the [ngrok agent](/agent/),
   [Agent SDKs](/agent-sdks) or [Kubernetes Controller](/k8s/). So which PoPs do
   those agents connect to? ngrok also applies GSLB principles to those
   connections as well to ensure that your agents connect to the geographically
   closest PoPs.

## Endpoints

ngrok's GSLB improves the performance and resiliency of connections to your
ngrok endpoints (e.g. `your-app.ngrok.dev`).

### Connection Acceleration

When a client (like a web browser) connects to your ngrok endpoint it is routed
to the closest point of presence. DNS resolution of your endpoint's address
returns the IP addresses of ngrok's closest point of presence. The closest point
of presence is determined by the shortest latency from the resolving DNS server
to our points of presence. This ensures that clients are routed to the fastest
point of presence even as internet routing conditions change.

Connecting to the closest point of presence accelerates your traffic by
reducing the initialization time for TCP and TLS connections. TCP and TLS
connection set up requires network round-trips. ngrok accelerates connections
by reducing the latency of these round-trip times (RTTs) between the client and
your endpoint by routing them to the closest point of presence.

### Module Acceleration

In addition to accelerating connection initialization, ngrok also accelerates
the execution of [Modules](/http/#modules) that you configure on your
endpoints. Modules execute where the request is first received by the ngrok
edge, at the geographically-closest point of presence. This means that any
behaviors you define in your modules are automatically globally accelerated for
all customers.

### Geo-Aware Load Balancing

When you are using a [Tunnel Group Backend](/network-edge/edges/#tunnel-group)
with [Edges](/network-edge/edges), ngrok can automatically distribute traffic
to the closest upstream if you run geographically distributed copies of your
upstream application service.

First, consider a case _without_ geo-aware load-balancing. Let's say you have
instances of your application running in Japan. When someone in Belgium makes
a request to your app's endpoint, that request will first be routed to the
closest ngrok point of presence in Europe, like Frankfurt. From Frankfurt, it
will then be routed through ngrok's internal network and finally to your
upstream services in Japan.

Then let's say you start additional copies of your application service in
France. With zero changes in configuration, those same requests from Belgium
will still be routed to ngrok's point of presence in Frankfurt, but instead of
routing to your upstream services in Japan, they will instead be routed to your
new upstreams in France. That's Geo-Aware Load Balancing.

### Losing an Upstream {#losing-an-upstream}

Consider the example in [Geo-Aware Load Balancing](#geo-aware-load-balancing)
where you are running upstream application services in both Japan and France.
Let's then assume that all of your upstream services in Japan fail. Requests
that were being routed to your Japanese upstream services will instead be
routed to your remaining upstream services in France. Requests that were
already being routed to your upstreams in France will be unaffected.

### Losing a Point of Presence {#endpoints-losing-a-pop}

In [losing an upstream](#losing-an-upstream), we considered a case where your
upstream services fail. But what if an ngrok point of presence fails?

If an ngrok point of presence fails, health checks automatically detect that
failure and update our DNS resolution such that clients will attempt to connect
to your endpoints via the next-closest healthy point of presence.

### Disabling GSLB for an Endpoint {#endpoints-disabling-gslb}

There is no way to disable GSLB for HTTPS and TLS endpoints. All endpoints you
create in ngrok are available on ngrok's worldwide global delivery network and
inbound requests and connections are routed to the geographically closest point
of presence.

### TCP Endpoints

TCP Endpoints do not support GSLB. Unlike domains, TCP addresses are
provisioned for a specific point of presence. When you create a TCP Address,
you must select the point of presence where it will accept traffic. Unlike
ngrok's globally routed domains, traffic to TCP addresses always enters ngrok's
network from that point of presence.

## Agents

ngrok's GSLB automatically improves the performance and resiliency of your
ngrok agents, agent SDKs and the Kubernetes Controller. Agents automatically
connect to ngrok's geographically-closest healthy point of presence.

### Acceleration

Similar to endpoints, when an ngrok agent connects, DNS resolution returns the
IPs of the closest ngrok point of presence. Connecting to the closest ngrok
point of presence reduces agent initialization time and also reduces the
latency of connections that are routed to that agent.

### Losing a Point of Presence {#agents-losing-a-pop}

If an ngrok point of presence fails, health checks automatically detect that
failure and update our DNS resolution such that agents will attempt to connect
to the next-closest healthy point of presence.

The ngrok agent connects to a single region at a time. If you want the ngrok
agent to simultaneously connect to multiple regions, you must instead run
multiple ngrok agents and [explicitly disable agent
GSLB](#agents-disabling-gslb).

### Disabling GSLB in the Agent {#agents-disabling-gslb}

You should always prefer to allow the ngrok agent to use GSLB and connect to
the closest point of presence. However, the ngrok agent does support disabling
GSLB and explicitly choosing which point of presence to connect to.

If you wish to configure the agent to use a specific point of presence you may
do so with the following configuration:

	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Legacy Agent Behavior

Beginning with the [ngrok v3
agent](/agent/changelog#ngrok-agent-300---2022-03-28), the agent uses GSLB to
connect to the lowest-latency point point of presence. Prior to that, v2 ngrok
agents would always connect to the US region by default.
