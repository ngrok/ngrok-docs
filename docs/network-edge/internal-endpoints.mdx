# Internal Endpoints

## Introduction

In addition to [public endpoints][Public Endpoints], ngrok also supports creating Internal Endpoints which are specific to your account.

All internal endpoints end in `.internal`, and are specific to one ngrok account.

Internal Endpoints cannot be accessed directly, but rather can only be accessed using the [forward-internal][forward-internal] policy action.

Internal endpoints are available in ngrok's pay-as-you-go plan. An internal endpoint that transmits data in a billing period is counted as an active endpoint for billing purposes.

### Creating a Internal Endpoint

A internal endpoint may be created by specifying a binding of `internal` for your endpoint. Specifically, when using the agent, a `internal` endpoint may be created like so:

```bash
ngrok http --binding internal --url "some.name.internal" 8080
```

A internal endpoint may listen on any port (such as `--url "some.name.internal:1234"`) and any protocol scheme (such as `ngrok tcp` and `ngrok tls`).
