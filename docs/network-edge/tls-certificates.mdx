# TLS Certificates

---

## Overview

When traffic reaches an HTTPS endpoint or a TLS endpoint, the ngrok edge may
[terminate TLS](/network-edge/#tls-termination) with a certificate and private
key pair. We call this pair of a certificate and private key a [TLS
Certificate](/concepts/#tls-certificate).

The TLS Certificate ngrok chooses for termination is the one pointed to by the
`certificate_id` of the [Domain](/api/resources/reserved-domains) object that
matches the endpoint the connection was received on.

If the Domain object does not point to any certificate, or there is no domain
object present, ngrok uses its own certificates for termination.

When you create a Domain, it is recommended that you always choose to use
[Automated TLS Certificates](#automated).

## Automated TLS Certificates {#automated}

ngrok can automatically provision and renew TLS certificates from
ACME-compliant certificate authorities like Let's Encrypt.

By default, when you create a [Domain](/concepts/#domain), ngrok will
automatically configure the domain to use Automated TLS Certificates.

When you create a branded domain like `api.example.com` (one that is not
subdomain of an ngrok-managed domain like `ngrok.app`), you must create a CNAME
DNS record with the Domain's (`cname_target`) at your DNS provider before a
certificate can begin to be provisioned. ngrok uses the HTTP01 challenge to
provision these certificates.

Automated TLS Certificates are provisioned asynchronously. Depending on the
speed of the ACME certificate authority, it can take anywhere from a few
seconds to a few minutes. The Domain's `certificate_management_status` field
communicates the status of the provisioning job.

If you created a wildcard domain, e.g. `*.app.example.com`, you will need to
create an additional CNAME record at `_acme-challenge.app.example.com` with the
value of the Domain's `acme_challenge_cname_target` field. This additional DNS
record is required because ngrok must use a DNS01 challenge to provision
wildcard certificates.

When using Automated TLS Certificates, ngrok automatically generates a new
private key for your domain and encrypts them at rest with with
[NaCL](https://nacl.cr.yp.to/).

## Bring your own TLS Certificates {#custom}

You may upload your own TLS Certificates if you don't want to use the TLS
certificates ngrok automatically provisions for you. Uploading your own
certificates may be the right choice if you are issuing certificates from your
own certificate authority or if you are using an EV certificate.

When you create a custom TLS certificate, you will upload a [Certificate
Bundle](#certificate-bundle) and a [Private Key](#private-key). Creating a TLS
Certificate will not change any traffic. You must attach the TLS Certificate to
the Domain. When working with the API, this is done by updating the
`certificate_id` property of the [Domain API
Resource](/api/resources/reserved-domains).

Unlike Automated TLS Certificates, when you are using custom TLS Certificates,
you are responsible for managing the renewal and rotation of new certificates.

### Certificate Bundles {#certificate-bundles}

When uploading your own TLS certificates to ngrok, you are expected to provide
a certificate bundle of all certificates necessary to establish a chain of
trust to a trusted root certificate authority. Many TLS certificate vendors
will provide you with a constructed certificate bundle, but some will return
the leaf certificate and the intermediate certificates separately and you must
concatenate them to construct the bundle yourself. This is the
`certificate_pem` field in the [TLS Certificate Create
API](/api/resources/tls-certificates/).

Certificate bundles are a series of PEM-encoded X.509 certificates that have
been concatenated together in a specific order. A bundle will look like the
following:

```pem
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----

-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----

-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

The first certificate in the bundle must be the leaf certificate. The leaf
certificate is the one which is signed for your domain and [the private
key](#private-keys) you will upload.

After the leaf certificate are the intermediates certificates, if any. Each
intermediate certificate signs the certificate preceding it in the bundle. As
an example, the first intermediate will sign the leaf, and that signature is
part of the leaf certificate itself. The final certificate will be signed by
the root certificate authority. You may also included the root certificate in
the bundle as well, but it is not necessary or common practice to do so.

### Private Keys {#private-keys}

ngrok accepts the following formats for the private key of an uploaded TLS
certificate. This is the `private_key_pem` field in the [TLS Certificate Create
API](/api/resources/tls-certificates/).

- RSA, in either PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 form.
- ECDSA, in either SEC 1 or PKCS#8 form.
- Ed25519, in PKCS#8 form.

Regardless of the format you choose, the private key must be formatted as ASN.1
DER, encoded as PEM.

ngrok will not accept any private keys that are encrypted (e.g. with DES).

ngrok encrypts uploaded private keys at rest with [NaCL](https://nacl.cr.yp.to/).
