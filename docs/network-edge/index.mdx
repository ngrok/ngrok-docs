# Network Edge

## Overview

The ngrok network edge is the globally distributed infrastructure that ngrok
operates. It accepts incoming traffic to your services' endpoint URLs, applies
your module configurations and routes those connections to the appropriate
connected ngrok agents.

## Points of Presence

ngrok's globally distributed network edge runs on points of presence all around
the world to enable fast, low latency traffic to your applications.

We continuously expand our regional points of presence. As we add each new
point of presence, your applications become faster for global customers without
any changes. The current points of presence are:

| Region Code | Location                   |
| ----------- | -------------------------- |
| ap          | Asia/Pacific (Singapore)   |
| au          | Australia (Sydney)         |
| eu          | Europe (Frankfurt)         |
| in          | India (Mumbai)             |
| jp          | Japan (Tokyo)              |
| sa          | South America (SÃ£o Paulo)  |
| us          | United States (Ohio)       |
| us-cal-1    | United States (California) |

## IP Addresses {#ip-addresses}

IPs used by the ngrok edge are dynamic. They may change frequently **_and
without notice_**. There are no static IPs. If you hardcode any of ngrok's IPs
or rely on DNS records past their TTL, your applications **_will break_**.
There is no API to query ngrok's IPs at this time.

When you resolve any of ngrok's IPs via DNS, you will receive a partial list of
IPs because ngrok uses [global server load balancing](/network-edge/gslb/),
which means that DNS queries will return different sets of IPs depending on
where you are located in the world.

For the avoidance of doubt, this includes but is not limited to all IPs used by
[Domains](/network-edge/domains-and-tcp-addresses/#domains), [TCP Addresses](/network-edge/domains-and-tcp-addresses/#tcp-addresses),
[Agent Ingress](/agent/ingress/), the Dashboard and [API](/api/).

Please [contact us](mailto:support@ngrok.com) if you need [dedicated static IPs
for a custom agent ingress address](/agent/ingress/#dedicated-ips).

## IPv6 Support

ngrok's network edge universally supports IPv6. DNS lookups for all
[Domains](/network-edge/domains-and-tcp-addresses/#domains) and the host portion of all [TCP
Addresses](/network-edge/domains-and-tcp-addresses/#tcp-addresses) will return `AAAA` DNS records.

Don't forget that ngrok supports IPv6 when configuring [IP
Restrictions](/http/ip-restrictions). If you forget to specify records to allow
IPv6 traffic, you may unintentionally cause connectivity failures if
connections to your endpoints use IPv6.

The [Agent](/agent/) and [Agent SDKs](/agent-sdks) may also connect to the
ngrok edge over IPv6. DNS lookups for the domain of the [agent
ingress](/agent/ingress/) address will return AAAA records.

## TLS Termination

ngrok terminates TLS traffic at its edge for [HTTPS endpoints](/http/) and
configurably for [TLS endpoints](/tls/). Regardless of the type of endpoint,
when the ngrok edge terminates TLS on incoming connections, it uses the TLS
certificate attached to the Domain it is terminating for. By default, ngrok
automatically attaches an appropriate TLS Certificate when a Domain is created,
provisioning one automatically if necessary.

| Endpoint Type        | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [HTTPS](/docs/http/) | ngrok always terminates TLS on connections to HTTPS endpoints at the ngrok edge. Traffic is re-encrypted with TLS as it is transmitted to your upstream service via the [Agent](/agent/).                                                       |
| [TLS](/docs/tls/)    | TLS endpoints may be configured to terminate TLS at the ngrok edge or not to terminate TLS. When a TLS endpoint is configured not to terminate TLS at ngrok's edge, we call this [Zero-Knowledge TLS](/tls/tls-termination#zero-knowledge-tls). |
| [TCP](/docs/tcp/)    | TCP endpoints are unaware of higher layer protocols like TLS and thus never terminate TLS.                                                                                                                                                      |

## DDoS Protection

ngrok helps protect your service from distributed denial of service (DDoS)
attacks. You can use the following measures with ngrok to protect your service
from DDoS attacks:

1. First, ngrok automatically applies a layer of DDoS protection to all of your
   endpoints without any configuration. Our software monitors all traffic flows
   into ngrok's edge by scanning for malicious sources, patterns and threats in
   real-time. ngrok proactively blocks incoming connections when an attack is
   detected.

1. Second, you can prevent attacks by enforcing authentication with modules
   like [OAuth](/http/oauth), [OpenID Connect](/http/openid-connect),
   [SAML](/http/saml) and [IP Restrictions](/http/ip-restrictions/).
   Authentication modules are enforced at the ngrok edge so that only legitimate
   traffic reaches the upstream service in your network. ngrok's edge absorbs
   all of the unauthenticated traffic.

1. Third, you can also recover more quickly from attacks by enabling the [Circuit
   Breaker module](/http/circuit-breaker/). This module protects your application
   services when they become overloaded by blocking traffic at the ngrok edge
   until they can recover.
