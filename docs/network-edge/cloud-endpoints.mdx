# Cloud Endpoints

:::warning

Cloud endpoints are currently in preview.
Breaking changes may occur at any time with no notice. One or more of the features listed below may not be available yet.

## Overview

Cloud endpoints enable you to centrally manage your endpoints' [traffic policy](/http/traffic-policy)
configurations in the cloud instead of defining them via an [Agent](/agent/) 
or [Agent SDK](/agent-sdks/). With Cloud Endpoints, you can update those 
configurations without taking your endpoints offline.

Cloud endpoints can be created, updated, or deleted via the ngrok dashboard[LINK TBD] 
or API[LINK TBD]. Unlike agent endpoints which are only online for as long as an
agent is connected, cloud endpoints are persistent and will remain online until they 
are explicitly deleted. You never have to restart the agent to pick up new traffic 
policy configurations. Cloud endpoints can be created for any one of the following
schemes: HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, TLS.

Cloud Endpoints enable you to:

- Enhance your endpoints with Traffic policies using the dashboard or API without 
restarting the Agent
- Centrally manage your traffic policy configurations in ngrok's cloud service
- Load balance traffic to different ngrok agents 
- Apply different configurations for each path in your application. For
  example, you may apply OAuth on `/app` and Compression on `/static/css`.
- Use the [Kubernetes Ingress Controller](/k8s/)

When you create a Cloud Endpoint, you must specify: 
- the complete URL for the cloud endpoint, including the scheme, hostname, and port. 
The port may be inferred if omitted
- the associated traffic policy
- the bindings [LINK?] associated with the cloud endpoint

Cloud endpoints are commonly used route traffic to agent endpoints (endpoints initiated by the ngrok agent) via the 
[forward action](/http/traffic-policy/actions/forward-internal/). The traffic policy of a 
cloud endpoint must either redirect or terminate traffic via actions such as deny, redirect,
custom-response, or forward via the forward action. 

For examples of cloud endpoint usage, check out the following guides:
	- Start a Cloud Endpoint that points at my Private [Agent?] Endpoint
	- Routing traffic to different Agent Endpoints based on path (load balancing?)

Cloud Endpoints vs Edges

Cloud endpoints are the new edges. In the near future, edges will become deprecated. Cloud endpoints offer all the functionality of edges and simplifies the module 
and backends system of modules by putting everything behind traffic policies. (Line about how existing edges will still work but new ones should be cloud endpoints? Asking Niji to clarify first here)
