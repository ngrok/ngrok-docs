# Cloud Endpoints

:::warning

Cloud endpoints are currently in private beta. The functionality listed below is not yet publicly available.

## Overview

Cloud endpoints enable you to centrally manage your endpoints' [traffic policy](/http/traffic-policy)
configurations in the cloud instead of defining them via an [Agent](/agent/)
or [Agent SDK](/agent-sdks/). With Cloud Endpoints, you can update those
configurations without taking your endpoints offline.

Cloud endpoints can be created, updated, or deleted via the ngrok dashboard
or [API](/api/resources/endpoints/). Unlike agent endpoints which are only online for as long as an
agent is connected, cloud endpoints are persistent and will remain online until they
are explicitly deleted. You never have to restart the agent to pick up new traffic
policy configurations. Cloud endpoints can be created for any one of the following
schemes: HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, TLS.

Cloud Endpoints enable you to:

- Enhance your endpoints with Traffic policies using the dashboard or API without
  restarting the Agent
- Centrally manage your traffic policy configurations in ngrok's cloud service
- Load balance traffic to different ngrok agents
- Apply different configurations for each path in your application. For
  example, you may apply OAuth on `/app` and Compression on `/static/css`.
- Use the [Kubernetes Ingress Controller](/k8s/)

When you create a Cloud Endpoint, you must specify:

- The complete URL for the cloud endpoint, including the scheme, hostname, and port.
  The port may be inferred if omitted
- The associated traffic policy
- The bindings associated with the cloud endpoint

Cloud endpoints are commonly used to route traffic to agent endpoints via the
[forward action](/http/traffic-policy/actions/forward-internal/). The traffic policy of a
cloud endpoint must either redirect or terminate traffic via actions such as deny, redirect,
custom-response, or forward via the forward action.

For examples of cloud endpoint usage, check out the following guides:

## Cloud Endpoints vs Edges

Cloud endpoints offer all the functionality of edges and simplify the module and backends
system of modules by putting everything behind traffic policies.
