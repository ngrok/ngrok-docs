# Edges

## Overview

Edges enable you to centrally manage your endpoints' Module configurations in
the ngrok dashboard or API instead of defining them via an [Agent](/agent/) or
[Agent SDK](/agent-sdks). With Edges, you can update those configurations
without taking your endpoints offline.

With Edges, you start your agent once and then configure it via the dashboard
or API. When you make changes to your Edge's configuration by adding or
updating modules, your app doesnâ€™t go offline. You never have to restart the
agent to pick up new command line flags or configuration files.

Edges enable you to:

- Enhance your endpoints with [Modules](#modules) using the dashboard or API
  without restarting the Agent.
- Centrally manage your module configurations in ngrok's cloud service. This
  decouples the configuration of module behavior on your endpoint from the agents
  where traffic is routed to.
- Load balance traffic to different ngrok agents
- Apply different configurations for each path in your application. For
  example, you may apply OAuth on `/app` and Compression on `/static/css`.
- Use the [Kubernetes Ingress Controller](/k8s/). The Ingress Controller is
  powered by Edges.

When you create an Edge, you must select the protocol corresponding to the
endpoints you would like it to create: one of HTTPS, TLS or TCP.

For additional detail on per-protocol Edge behavior, see:

- [HTTPS Edges](/http/#edges)
- [TLS Edges](/tls/#edges)
- [TCP Edges](/tcp/#edges)

## Modules

Modules are a type of middleware that enable you to manipulate traffic to your applications.
Modules can provide authentication, resiliency, acceleration, transformation,
security and observability to the traffic that transits through ngrok to your upstream
applications.

## Backends

After traffic to an Edge has been processed by the Modules, it is sent to a
Backend. A Backend is the last middleware to be applied to your traffic
and it determines where the traffic is sent. There are multiple types of
Backends, each with different behaviors.

### Tunnel Group

Tunnel Group backends allow you to load balance traffic equally among multiple
ngrok agents. Tunnel Group backends define a _label selector_. A Tunnel Group
backend will balance traffic among all ngrok tunnels whose labels match its
label selector.

For example, if your Tunnel Group has a label selector of `app=dashboard, version=1`:

- A tunnel with the labels `app=dashboard, version=1` will match
- A tunnel with the labels `app=dashboard, version=1, color=blue` will match.
- A tunnel with the labels `app=api, version=1` will not match.

Agents and Agent SDKs can start labeled tunnels. Using our previous example of
a tunnel group with the label selector of `app=dashboard, version=1`, you can
start a matching tunnel with:

```bash
ngrok tunnel 80 --label="app=dashboard,version=1"
```

Consult the documentation of the [`ngrok tunnel` command in the ngrok
agent](/agent/cli#ngrok-tunnel) for additional details.

When used with HTTPS edges, balancing among tunnels is distributed on a
per-request basis.

When used with TLS or TCP edges, balancing among tunnels is distributed on a
per-connection basis.

### HTTP Response

HTTP Response backends return a fixed HTTP response with a status code, header
and body text that you configure. HTTP Response backends are useful to:

- Render customized error pages like 503 when used as part of a failover
  backend
- Redirect traffic with a 30X redirect response for a Route that it is set on

### Failover

Failover backends define multiple other backends to try in order. The first
backend that succeeds will be used. A backend 'fails' only if it cannot be
dialed. If a connection is established or an HTTP request is sent to a backend,
no failover will occur, even if the backend fails to respond or responds with
an error.

### Weighted

Weighted backends will distribute traffic to one or more backends proportional
to the `weight` for each of its backends. Weighted backends are useful for:

- Canary deploys where you want to distribute a small percentage of traffic to
  new backends
- Gradual rollout deployments where traffic is slowly migrated from the
  previous version of an upstream service to a newer version
- A/B testing different versions of the same service

When used with HTTPS edges, balancing among child backends is distributed on a
per-request basis.

When used with TLS or TCP edges, balancing among child backends is distributed
on a per-connection basis.
