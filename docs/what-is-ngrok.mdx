# What is ngrok?

## What is ngrok?

ngrok is a globally distributed reverse proxy that secures, protects and
accelerates your applications and network services, no matter where you run
them. You can think of ngrok as the front door to your applications.

ngrok is _environment independent_ because it can deliver traffic to services
running anywhere with no changes to your environment's networking. Run your app
on AWS, Azure, Heroku, an on-premise Kubernetes cluster, a Raspberry Pi, and
even your laptop. With ngrok, it all works the same.

ngrok is a _unified ingress platform_ because it combines all the components to
deliver traffic from your services to the internet into one. ngrok
consolidates together your reverse proxy, load balancer, API gateway, firewall,
delivery network, DDoS protection and more.

## What can you do with ngrok?

### Development and Testing

- **Webhook Testing**: Run ngrok on your local machine to get a URL to receive
  webhooks directly in the app you're developing. [Inspect and replay
  requests](/agent/web-inspection-interface/) for fast development.
- **Local Previews**: Demo a website running on your local machine to a client
  or stakeholder without deploying to a staging site.
- **Mobile Backend Testing**: Test your mobile apps against a backend that
  you're developing on your local machine.

### Ingress to external networks

- **APIs in customer networks**: Run the lightweight [ngrok agent](/agent/) or
  [Kubernetes controller](/k8s/) in your customers' environments to securely
  connect to APIs in their networks without complex network configuration.
- **APIs on devices**: Run [ngrok as a service](/agent/#background-service) on
  your devices to create secure URLs for their local APIs enabling your cloud
  service to control and administrate them.
- **APIs in local dev environments**: Import [ngrok as a library](/agent-sdks)
  into your own CLI so you can create better local dev experiences for your
  developer customers.

### Production Ingress

- API Gateway: Use ngrok's [HTTP modules](/http/#modules) to secure, protect,
  accelerate and transform traffic to your production APIs.
- Kubernetes Ingress: Run [ngrok's Ingress Controller](/k8s/) to create ingress
  to k8s services running in any Kubernetes cluster.
- Identity-Aware Proxy: Use ngrok's [OAuth](/http/oauth), [SAML](/http/saml/),
  or [OpenID Connect](/http/openid-connect) modules to federate your app's
  authentication to an identity provider.
- Load Balancer: Use [Edges](/network-edge/edges/) to load balance traffic for
  scalability and failover or to do blue/green and canary deployments.

### Remote Access

- SSH: Create [TCP endpoints](/tcp/) to enable SSH access to remote machines.
- RDP: Create [TCP endpoints](/tcp/) to enable RDP access to remote machines.
