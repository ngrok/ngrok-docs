# Traffic Policy

## Overview

This module allows you to assign a policy to your endpoints containing a series
of inbound and outbound rules that can be used to influence and control traffic
to and from your upstream service.

Policy rules are composed of expressions that filter the traffic on which they are applicable
and actions that should take effect.

## Example Usage

<Tabs groupId="connectivity" queryString="cty">
	<TabItem value="agent-cli" label="Agent CLI">
		<AgentCliExample />
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="agent-config" label="Agent Config">
		<AgentConfigExample />
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="ssh" label="SSH">
		<SshExample />
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="go-sdk" label="Go">
		<GoSdkExample />
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="javascript-sdk" label="Javascript">
		<JavascriptSdkExample />
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="python-sdk" label="Python">
		<PythonSdkExample />
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="rust-sdk" label="Rust">
		<RustSdkExample />
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="k8s" label="Kubernetes Controller">
		<KubernetesExample />
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Behavior

Policy rules are evaluated sequentially in the order they are configured with inbound rules taking effect before the
upstream server is reached and outbound rules taking effect after the upstream server responds. Whether or not the configured
actions are performed is determined at runtime by the expressions.

### Expression Evaluation

Policy expressions are written using the [Common Expression Language (CEL)](https://github.com/google/cel-spec). Policy expressions must evaluate to true
in order for policy actions to take effect. There is no behavioral difference between adding multiple expressions to a single policy rule and having one
single expression with multiple statements logically conjoined together (i.e. `["1 == 1 && 2 == 2"]` is the same
s `["1 == 1", "2 == 2"]`).

If no expressions are specified on a policy rule, its actions will always take effect.

### Action Execution

If a policy's expressions are evaluated as a match against a connection, the policy's actions will be executed. If multiple actions are defined
on a policy, the actions will execute sequentially.

See [actions](./actions) for all available actions.

### Configuration

| Parameter       | Description                                                                                                            |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **inbound**     | A list of policy rules that will be applied to inbound traffic in the order specified.                                 |
| **outbound**    | A list of policy rules that will be applied to outbound traffic in the order specified.                                |
| **name**        | Policy rules can optionally be given a name for convenience.                                                           |
| **expressions** | A list of CEL expressions that filter which traffic a policy rule will apply to.                                       |
| **actions**     | A list of actions that will execute sequentially if the associated policy rule's expressions all match on the traffic. |
| **type**        | The type of action.                                                                                                    |
| **config**      | The configuration details of how an action should execute. Each action has its own configuration structure.            |

## Edges

Traffic Policy is a TLS Edge module.

The Traffic Policy module can be configured vai the ngrok dashboard or API.
