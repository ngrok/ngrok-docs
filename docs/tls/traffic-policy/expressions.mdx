# Expressions

A policy is written with [Common Expression Language (CEL)](https://github.com/google/cel-spec) expressions
to determine on which connections it is applicable. Each policy expression must evaluate to true in order for
the policy's actions to take effect against a connection.

## Variables

Attributes of the connection are exposed on the `conn` struct. The following variables are available using this struct:

| Name                       | Type   | Description                                                                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `conn.ClientIP`            | string | The source IP of the TCP connection to the ngrok endpoint.                                             |
| `conn.Geo.CountryCode`     | string | The two-letter ISO country code based on the client IP.                                                |
| `conn.Geo.Latitude`        | string | The approximate latitude based on the client IP.                                                       |
| `conn.Geo.Longitude`       | string | The approximate longitude based on the client IP.                                                      |
| `conn.Geo.LatLongRadiusKm` | string | The radius in kilometers around the latitude and longitude where the client IP is likely to originate. |
| `conn.TLS.CertCN`          | string | The subject common name of the leaf TLS certificate                                                    |
| `conn.TLS.CipherSuite`     | string | The cipher suite negotiated on the connection.                                                         |
| `conn.TLS.Version`         | string | The TLS Version used on the connection.                                                                |
| `conn.TLS.SNI`             | string | The Server Name Indication extension sent.                                                             |
