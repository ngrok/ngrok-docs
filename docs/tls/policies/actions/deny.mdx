# Deny

## Overview 

The `deny` policy action allows you to reject incoming requests to your endpoint. 

## Behavior

When this action is executed, the upstream server is never reached and a response is immediately made. 

If this action is executed, no further actions or policies in the policy configuration will be executed.
