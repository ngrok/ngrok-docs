Header manipulation is one of the most common features that that users need from their API Gateway. The following configuration examples will showcase how you can add, remove, and set request and response headers.
Gateway API contains native configuration for this that is supported by the ngrok Kubernetes operator. 

✅ Gateway API natively supports header manipulation, and this feature is fully supported by the ngrok Kubernetes operator. <br />
❌ `Ingress` resources do not have native configuration for header manipulation, but they can be extended to take advantage of ngrok's [add headers](/traffic-policy/actions/add-headers/) and [remove headers](/traffic-policy/actions/remove-headers/) traffic policy actions.

# Customizing Requests with Header Manipulation

Header manipulation is a core feature of API Gateways that allows you to modify HTTP headers on incoming requests and outgoing responses. 
This enables better security, routing, debugging, and interoperability between services.

By adding, modifying, or removing headers, you can:
- 🛠 Enrich requests with additional metadata before they reach your backend.
- 🔒 Enhance security by stripping sensitive headers from responses.
- 🚀 Enable service compatibility by adjusting headers for different upstream APIs.


## 🔍 Why Modify Headers?

Headers contain critical metadata that helps control authentication, caching, routing, security, and debugging. 
Modifying headers at the gateway level ensures consistency without requiring upstream service changes.

Key Benefits:
- **Modify Requests at the Edge:** Adjust headers before requests reach your services.
- **Ensure API Compatibility:** Add or modify headers to meet the expectations of different backends.
- **Improve Security & Privacy:** Strip unnecessary or sensitive headers from responses.
- **Simplify Authentication & Tracing:** Add authentication tokens or tracking headers for better monitoring.
- **Reduce Backend Overhead:** Offload header transformations from your application code.
- **Enhancing Security:** Remove headers like Server to hide backend details from attackers.
- **Injecting Authentication Headers:** Add Authorization headers for SSO, API tokens, or identity providers.
- **Adding Debugging & Tracing Information:** Inject X-Request-ID or Trace-Id headers for observability and monitoring.
