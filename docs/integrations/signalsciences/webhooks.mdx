# Signal Sciences Webhooks

:::tip TL;DR

To integrate Signal Sciences webhooks with ngrok:

1. [Launch your local webhook.](#start-your-app) `npm start`
1. [Launch ngrok.](#start-ngrok) `ngrok http 3000`
1. [Configure Signal Sciences webhooks with your ngrok URL.](#setup-webhook)
1. [Secure your webhook requests with verification.](#security)

:::

This guide covers how to use ngrok to integrate your localhost app with Signal Sciences by using Webhooks.
Signal Sciences webhooks can be used to notify an external application whenever specific events occur in your Signal Sciences account.

By integrating ngrok with Signal Sciences, you can:

- **Develop and test Signal Sciences webhooks locally**, eliminating the time in deploying your development code to a public environment and setting it up in HTTPS.
- **Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Signal Sciences** in real-time via the inspection UI and API.
- **Modify and Replay Signal Sciences Webhook requests** with a single click and without spending time reproducing events manually in your Signal Sciences account.
- **Secure your app with Signal Sciences validation provided by ngrok**. Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## **Step 1**: Start your app {#start-your-app}

For this tutorial, we'll use the [sample NodeJS app available on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install this sample, run the following commands in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

This will get the project installed locally.

Now you can launch the app by running the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs by default on port 3000.

You can validate that the app is up and running by visiting http://localhost:3000. The application logs request headers and body in the terminal and responds with a message in the browser.

## **Step 2**: Launch ngrok {#start-ngrok}

Once your app is running successfully on localhost, let's get it on the internet securely using ngrok!

1. If you're not an ngrok user yet, just [sign up for ngrok for free](https://ngrok.com/signup).

1. [Download the ngrok agent](https://download.ngrok.com).

1. Go to the [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com) and copy your Authtoken. <br />
   **Tip:** The ngrok agent uses the auth token to log into your account when you start a tunnel.
1. Start ngrok by running the following command:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

1. ngrok will display a URL where your localhost application is exposed to the internet (copy this URL for use with Signal Sciences).

## **Step 3**: Integrate Signal Sciences {#setup-webhook}

To register a webhook on your Signal Sciences account follow the instructions below:

1. Access the [Signal Sciences Dashboard](https://dashboard.signalsciences.net/) and sign in using your Signal Sciences account.

1. On the **Dashboard** page, select your site from the **Sites** drop-down menu on the top of the screen, click **Site Manage** on the top menu, click **Site Integrations**, and then click **Add site integration**.

1. On the **Add site integration** page, click **Generic Webhook**.

1. On the **Generic Webhook** page, enter the URL provided by the ngrok agent to expose your application to the internet in the **Webhook URL** field (i.e. `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).

1. Select **All activity** and then click **Create site integration**.

### Run Webhooks with Signal Sciences and ngrok

Signal Sciences sends different request body contents depending on the event that is being triggered.
You can trigger new calls from Signal Sciences to your application by following the instructions below.

1. Access the [Signal Sciences Dashboard](https://dashboard.signalsciences.net/), sign in, and change your site display name.

   Confirm your localhost app receives an event notification and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

<InspectingRequests />

<ReplayingRequests />
## Secure webhook requests {#security}

The ngrok signature webhook verification feature allows ngrok to assert that requests from your Signal Sciences webhook are the only traffic allowed to make calls to your localhost app.

**Note:** This ngrok feature is limited to 500 validations per month on free ngrok accounts. For unlimited, upgrade to Pro or Enterprise.

This is a quick step to add extra protection to your application.

1. Access the [Signal Sciences Dashboard](https://dashboard.signalsciences.net/), sign in, click **Site Integrations** in the **Manage** menu, and then click on your webhook.

1. On the **Webhook** page, click the eye icon to reveal the **secret key** value and then copy this value.

1. Create a traffic policy file named `signalsciences_policy.yml`, replacing `{your webhook secret}` with the value you have copied before:

   ```yaml
   on_http_request:
     - actions:
         - type: verify-webhook
           config:
             provider: signalsciences
             secret: "{your webhook secret}"
   ```

1. Restart your ngrok agent by running the command:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file signalsciences_policy.yml
   ```

1. Access the [Signal Sciences Dashboard](https://dashboard.signalsciences.net/), sign in, and change your site display name.

   Confirm your localhost app receives an event notification and logs both headers and body in the terminal.
