# Google OAuth

By default, if you use `"google"` for OAuth in your traffic policies without specifying a Google OAuth application, visitors to your endpoint will be authenticated using an ngrok managed Google OAuth instance.

Setting up your own Google OAuth application will allow you to customize how authentication works with fine-grained detail. This guide walks you through setting up a Google OAuth 2.0 application to use with your ngrok endpoints.

## 1. Build the consent screen

1.  Create or select a project on the [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com).
2.  Navigate to the project's [OAuth consent screen](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials/consent).
3.  Select whether your application is an [internal or external app](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en#public-and-internal).
4.  Fill out the application name and support email.
5.  Add additional scopes required by your application, saving the full scope URI for later.
    - [Possible scope URIs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes)
      .
6.  Ensure that the `email` and `profile` scopes are still selected.
7.  Under Authorized domains, add `ngrok.com` and your application homepage domain.
8.  Add links to your application homepage and privacy policy. The final consent screen should resemble: ![](/img/howto/oauth/1-google-consent_screen_complete.png)
9.  Save the application.
    - Applications that require verification cannot complete the consent screen and are not supported by ngrok.

## 2. Create credentials for ngrok

1.  Navigate to [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) for your project.
2.  Select "Create credentials" from the top menu and select "OAuth Client ID".
3.  Choose "Web application" from the list of application types.
4.  Name your secret, then set "Authorized Redirect URIs" to `https://idp.ngrok.com/oauth2/callback`. The final credentials form should resemble: ![](/img/howto/oauth/2-google-create_client_id.png)
5.  Securely store the client ID and secret from the final screen: ![](/img/howto/oauth/3-google-client_id_and_secret.png)

## 3. Update your ngrok endpoint traffic policy
