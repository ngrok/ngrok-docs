title: Kubernetes ingress to apps/APIs on clusters managed by Canonical MicroK8s
description: Add ingress to any app running in a Kubernetes cluster managed by Canonical Microk8s using the ngrok Kubernetes Operator.
---

Using this guide, you'll launch a new Kubernetes cluster with Canonical's open-source [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io/) and use the [ngrok Kubernetes Operator](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/ngrok-ingress-controller) to securely ingress public traffic to an example app using the **new [Kubernetes Gateway API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/gateway/)**.

Along the way, you'll learn enough to leverage MicroK8s in your next Kubernetes deployment—local development, embedded in a CI environment, and production workloads—with simple and secure traffic ingress.

Here is what you'll be building with:

- The **[ngrok Kubernetes Operator](https://ngrok.com/blog-post/ngrok-k8s)**: ngrok's official controller for adding secure public ingress and middleware execution to your Kubernetes apps with ngrok's Cloud Edge. With ngrok, you can manage and secure app traffic at every stage of the development lifecycle while benefiting from simpler configurations, security, and edge acceleration.
- The **Kubernetes Gateway API**: This new API, which made generally available in [October 2023](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/10/31/gateway-api-ga/), is a role-oriented mechanism for provisioning load-balancing infrastructure and routing traffic. The Gateway API does not replace "traditional" [Operators](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/)—both are available for production usage, but the Gateway API may be better suited for large organizations with defined roles for managing Kubernetes services, cluster operators vs. application developers.
- **Canonical MicroK8s**: An open-source system for low-ops, minimal, production-ready Kubernetes. MicroK8s' single-node configuration, small size, and customizeable footprint lets you use it for local development, in minimal environments like GitHub's CI/CD, or using Kubernetes on IoT hardware.

## What you'll need

- [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io/) installed locally.
- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup).
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) and [Helm
  3.0.0+](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) installed on your local
  workstation.
- The [ngrok Kubernetes Operator](/docs/k8s/installation/install/) installed on
  your cluster.
- A reserved domain, which you can get in the ngrok
  [dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains) or with the [ngrok
  API](https://ngrok.com/docs/api/resources/reserved-domains/).
  - You can choose from an ngrok subdomain or bring your own custom branded
    domain, like `https://api.example.com`.
  - We'll refer to this domain as `<NGROK_DOMAIN>`.

## Deploy a Kubernetes cluster with MicroK8s {#deploy-a-kubernetes-cluster-with-microk8s}

Start by deploying a new single-node MicroK8s Kubernetes cluster in your chosen environment. That could be your local workstation, an IoT device, a virtual machine in the cloud, or any system running one of the [42 supported flavors of Linux](https://snapcraft.io/microk8s).

1. Follow the [get started](https://microk8s.io/docs/getting-started) tutorial for MicroK8s to install the binary for your target system.

   Once Microk8s is installed, it automatically deploys a single-node Kubernetes cluster.

1. Run `microk8s status --wait-ready` to check on the state of your MicroK8s cluster.

   ```bash
   microk8s status --wait-ready

   microk8s is running
   high-availability: no
     datastore master nodes: 127.0.0.1:19001
     datastore standby nodes: none
   ...
   ```

   If you see `microk8s is ready`, your new cluster is ready to go!

## Install an example app {#install-example-app}

Now you need a domain and Kubernetes service to ingress traffic to!

1. If you don't have an ngrok static domain, create one. Navigate to the [**Domains** section](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains) of the ngrok dashboard and click **Create Domain** or **New Domain**. This static domain, which will look like `example.ngrok.app`, will be your `NGROK_DOMAIN` for the remainder of this guide.

   Creating a subdomain on the ngrok network provides a public route to accept HTTP, HTTPS, and TLS traffic.

1. Create a new Kubernetes manifest (`2048.yaml`) with the YAML below. This manifest defines the 2048 application service and deployment, then configures the ngrok Kubernetes Operator to connect the `game-2048` service to the ngrok edge via your `NGROK_DOMAIN`.

   ```yaml showLineNumbers
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: game-2048
     namespace: default
   spec:
     ports:
       - name: http
         port: 80
         targetPort: 80
     selector:
       app: game-2048
   ---
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: game-2048
     namespace: default
   spec:
     replicas: 1
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: game-2048
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: game-2048
       spec:
         containers:
           - name: backend
             image: alexwhen/docker-2048
             ports:
               - name: http
                 containerPort: 80
   ```

1. Apply the `2048.yaml` manifest to your MicroK8s cluster.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f 2048.yaml
   ```

## Configure the ngrok Kubernetes Operator {#configure-ngrok-operator-kubernetes-gateway-api}

With your example app running alongside the ngrok Kubernetes Operator, you now need to configure the new [Kubernetes Gateway API](/k8s/?k8s-install=gatewayAPI) to route traffic arriving from outside the cluster on `NGROK_DOMAIN` to the `game-2048` service.

You'll first create a [GatewayClass](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/gatewayclass/), which represents a class of cluster-level [Gateways](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/gateway/). You'll then configure the Gateway with a listener, and an [HTTPRoute](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/httproute/) to specify how the Gateway should route requests.

1. Create a new file called `gatewayclass.yaml` on your workstation with the below YAML:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: GatewayClass
   metadata:
     name: ngrok
   spec:
     controllerName: ngrok.com/gateway-controller
   ```

1. Install the GatewayClass:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f gatewayclass.yaml
   ```

1. Create a new file named `2048-gateway.yaml` on your workstation with the below YAML, replacing `<YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN>`:

   ```yaml showLineNumbers
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: Gateway
   metadata:
     name: 2048-gateway
     namespace: default
   spec:
     gatewayClassName: ngrok
     listeners:
       - name: 2048-web
   			 protocol: HTTPS
   			 port: 80
         hostname: "<YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN>"
   			 allowedRoutes:
   			   namespaces:
   				   from: Same
   ---
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: HTTPRoute
   metadata:
     name: 2048-route
     namespace: default
   spec:
     parentRefs:
       - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
   			 kind: Gateway
         name: 2048-gateway
         namespace: default
     hostnames:
       - "<YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN>"
     rules:
       - matches:
           - path:
               type: PathPrefix
               value: /
         backendRefs:
           - name: game-2048
             kind: Service
             port: 80
   ```

   This YAML uses the [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/#introduction) to first define a [Gateway](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/gateway) that allows north/south traffic to enter the cluster from external requests, then uses an [HTTPRoute](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/concepts/api-overview/#httproute) to terminate the connection at the pod running the `game-2048` service.

1. Access your 2048 demo app by navigating to your ngrok domain, e.g. `https://<YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN>`. ngrok's network
   and the ngrok Kubernetes Operator routes traffic to your app from any device or external network.
