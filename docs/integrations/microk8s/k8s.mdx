# Ingress to Kubernetes apps on clusters managed by Canonical MicroK8s

:::tip TL;DR

To use the ngrok Kubernetes Operator, which now supports the Kubernetes Gateway API spec, with Canonical MicroK8s:

1. [Deploy a Kubernetes cluster with MicroK8s](#deploy-a-kubernetes-cluster-with-microk8s)
1. [Deploy the ngrok Kubernetes Operator](#deploy-ngrok-kubernetes-operator)
1. [Install an example app](#install-example-app)
1. [Configure the ngrok Operator](#configure-ngrok-operator-kubernetes-gateway-api)

:::

Using this guide, you'll launch a new Kubernetes cluster with Canonical's open-source [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io/) and use the [ngrok Kubernetes Operator](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/ngrok-ingress-controller) to securely ingress public traffic to an example app using the **new [Kubernetes Gateway API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/gateway/)**.

Along the way, you'll learn enough to leverage MicroK8s in your next Kubernetes deployment—local development, embedded in a CI environment, and production workloads—with simple and secure traffic ingress.

Here is what you'll be building with:

- The **[ngrok Kubernetes Operator](https://ngrok.com/blog-post/ngrok-k8s)**: ngrok's official controller for adding secure public ingress and middleware execution to your Kubernetes apps with ngrok's Cloud Edge. With ngrok, you can manage and secure app traffic at every stage of the development lifecycle while benefiting from simpler configurations, security, and edge acceleration.
- The **Kubernetes Gateway API**: This new API, which made generally available in [October 2023](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/10/31/gateway-api-ga/), is a role-oriented mechanism for provisioning load-balancing infrastructure and routing traffic. The Gateway API does not replace "traditional" [Ingress Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/)—both are available for production usage, but the Gateway API may be better suited for large organizations with defined roles for managing Kubernetes services, cluster operators vs. application developers.
- **Canonical MicroK8s**: An open-source system for low-ops, minimal, production-ready Kubernetes. MicroK8s' single-node configuration, small size, and customizeable footprint lets you use it for local development, in minimal environments like GitHub's CI/CD, or using Kubernetes on IoT hardware.

:::caution This how-to guide requires:

1. An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup) at any tier.
1. [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io/) installed locally.
1. [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) installed locally.
1. [Helm 3.0.0+](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) installed locally.

:::

## **Step 1**: Deploy a Kubernetes cluster with MicroK8s {#deploy-a-kubernetes-cluster-with-microk8s}

Start by deploying a new single-node MicroK8s Kubernetes cluster in your chosen environment. That could be your local workstation, an IoT device, a virtual machine in the cloud, or any system running one of the [42 supported flavors of Linux](https://snapcraft.io/microk8s).

1. Follow the [get started](https://microk8s.io/docs/getting-started) tutorial for MicroK8s to install the binary for your target system.

   Once Microk8s is installed, it automatically deploys a single-node Kubernetes cluster.

1. Run `microk8s status --wait-ready` to check on the state of your MicroK8s cluster.

   ```bash
   microk8s status --wait-ready

   microk8s is running
   high-availability: no
     datastore master nodes: 127.0.0.1:19001
     datastore standby nodes: none
   ...
   ```

   If you see `microk8s is ready`, your new cluster is ready to go!

## **Step 2**: Deploy the ngrok Kubernetes Operator {#deploy-ngrok-kubernetes-operator}

Now that you have a Kubernetes cluster deployed using MicroK8s, you can install the [ngrok Kubernetes Operator](https://github.com/ngrok/kubernetes-ingress-controller) for secure ingress.

1. Add the Helm repository:

   ```bash
   helm repo add ngrok https://charts.ngrok.com
   ```

1. Install the latest Gateway API CRDs to your cluster:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/download/v1.0.0/standard-install.yaml
   ```

1. Set up the `AUTHTOKEN` and `API_KEY` exports, which allows Helm to install the Ingress Controller using your ngrok credentials. Find your `AUTHTOKEN` under [**Your Authtoken**](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) in the ngrok dashboard.

   To create a new API key, navigate to the [**API** section](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/api) of the ngrok dashboard, click the **New API Key** button, change the description or owner, and click the **Add API Key** button. Copy the API key token shown in the modal window before closing it, as the ngrok dashboard will not show you the token again.

   ```bash
   export NGROK_AUTHTOKEN=[YOUR-AUTHTOKEN]
   export NGROK_API_KEY=[YOUR-API-KEY]
   ```

1. Install the ngrok Ingress Controller with Helm under a new `ngrok-ingress-controller` namespace, with the `useExperimentalGatewayApi=true` option.

   ```bash
   helm install ngrok-ingress-controller ngrok/kubernetes-ingress-controller \
     --namespace ngrok-ingress-controller \
     --create-namespace \
     --set credentials.apiKey=$NGROK_API_KEY \
     --set credentials.authtoken=$NGROK_AUTHTOKEN \
     --set useExperimentalGatewayApi=true
   ```

1. Verify you have installed the ngrok Kubernetes Operator successfully via a single running pod.

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods --namespace ngrok-ingress-controller

   NAME                                                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   ngrok-ingress-controller-kubernetes-ingress-controller-man2fg5p   1/1     Running   0          2m23s
   ```

## **Step 3**: Install an example app {#install-example-app}

Now you need a domain and Kubernetes service to ingress traffic to!

1. If you don't have an ngrok static domain, create one. Navigate to the [**Domains** section](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/cloud-edge/domains) of the ngrok dashboard and click **Create Domain** or **New Domain**. This static domain, which will look like `example.ngrok.app`, will be your `NGROK_DOMAIN` for the remainder of this guide.

   Creating a subdomain on the ngrok network provides a public route to accept HTTP, HTTPS, and TLS traffic.

1. Create a new Kubernetes manifest (`2048.yaml`) with the YAML below. This manifest defines the 2048 application service and deployment, then configures the ngrok Kubernetes Operator to connect the `game-2048` service to the ngrok edge via your `NGROK_DOMAIN`.

   ```yaml showLineNumbers
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: game-2048
     namespace: ngrok-ingress-controller
   spec:
     ports:
       - name: http
         port: 80
         targetPort: 80
     selector:
       app: game-2048
   ---
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: game-2048
     namespace: ngrok-ingress-controller
   spec:
     replicas: 1
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: game-2048
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: game-2048
       spec:
         containers:
           - name: backend
             image: alexwhen/docker-2048
             ports:
               - name: http
                 containerPort: 80
   ```

1. Apply the `2048.yaml` manifest to your MicroK8s cluster.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f 2048.yaml
   ```

## **Step 4**: Configure the ngrok Kubernetes Operator {#configure-ngrok-operator-kubernetes-gateway-api}

With your example app running alongside the ngrok Kubernetes Operator, you now need to configure the new [Kubernetes Gateway API](https://ngrok.com/docs/k8s/?k8s-install=gatewayAPI) to route traffic arriving from outside the cluster on `NGROK_DOMAIN` to the `game-2048` service.

You'll first create a [GatewayClass](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/gatewayclass/), which represents a class of cluster-level [Gateways](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/gateway/). You'll then configure the Gateway with a listener, and an [HTTPRoute](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/httproute/) to specify how the Gateway should route requests.

1. Create a new file called `gatewayclass.yaml` on your workstation with the below YAML:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: GatewayClass
   metadata:
     name: ngrok
   spec:
     controllerName: ngrok.com/gateway-controller
   ```

1. Install the GatewayClass:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f gatewayclass.yaml
   ```

1. Create a new file named `2048-gateway.yaml` on your workstation with the below YAML:

   :::tip

   Make sure you edit L10 and L37 to replace the `NGROK_DOMAIN` variable with the domain you created before.

   :::

   ```yaml showLineNumbers
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: Gateway
   metadata:
     name: 2048-gateway
     namespace: ngrok-ingress-controller
   spec:
     gatewayClassName: ngrok
     listeners:
       - name: 2048-web
         #highlight-start
         hostname: "NGROK_DOMAIN"

         port: 80
         protocol: HTTPS
         tls:
           mode: Terminate
           certificateRefs:
             - name: ngrokcert #ngrok will generate the cert so this cert does not be defined and will be ignored if defined
         allowedRoutes:
           kinds:
             - kind: HTTPRoute
           namespaces:
             from: Selector
             selector:
               matchLabels:
                 expose-apps: "true"
   ---
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: HTTPRoute
   metadata:
     name: 2048-route
     namespace: ngrok-ingress-controller
   spec:
     parentRefs:
       - kind: Gateway
         name: 2048-gateway
         namespace: ngrok-ingress-controller
     hostnames:
       #highlight-start
       - "NGROK_DOMAIN"
       #highlight-end
     rules:
       - matches:
           - path:
               type: PathPrefix
               value: /
         backendRefs:
           - name: game-2048
             kind: Service
             port: 80
   ```

   :::tip

   **Note:** If you get an error when applying the manifest, double check that you've updated the `NGROK_DOMAIN` value
   and try again.

   :::

   This YAML uses the [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/#introduction) to first define a [Gateway](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/gateway) that allows north/south traffic to enter the cluster from external requests, then uses an [HTTPRoute](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/concepts/api-overview/#httproute) to terminate the connection at the pod running the `game-2048` service.

1. Access your 2048 demo app by navigating to your ngrok domain, e.g. `https://NGROK_DOMAIN`. ngrok's Cloud Edge
   and the ngrok Kubernetes Operator routes traffic to your app from any device or external network.

## What's next?

Because the ngrok Kubernetes Operator's use of the Gateway API is still experimental, not all the same features are available compared to the traditional [Ingress CRD method](https://ngrok.com/docs/k8s/?k8s-install=ingress). However, the Kubernetes API is the new standard API for routing traffic, you'll benefit from starting from a more recent foundation in favor of a later migration.

Certain modifications, like [changing headers](https://ngrok.com/docs/k8s/?k8s-basic-path=gatewayAPI#modify-headers) and [redirecting traffic](https://ngrok.com/docs/k8s/?k8s-basic-path=gatewayAPI#redirect-traffic) based on paths, are currently supported.

To track the development of the ngrok Kubernetes Operator and its use of the new Kubernetes Gateway API, check out the [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/ngrok/kubernetes-ingress-controller) and give it a ⭐.
