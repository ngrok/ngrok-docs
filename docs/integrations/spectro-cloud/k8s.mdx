# Ingress to Kubernetes apps deployed on Spectro Cloud Palette

:::tip TL;DR

To use the ngrok Kubernetes Ingress Controller with Spectro Cloud Palette:

1. [Create a cluster in Palette](#create-a-cluster-in-palette)
2. [Add the ngrok Kubernetes Ingress Controller via Palette Pack](#add-ngrok-kubernetes-controller-palette-pack)
3. [TK](#)

:::caution This tutorial requires:

1. An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup) at any tiers.
2. A [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com/) account with Spectro Cloud.
3. An account, with necessary privileges, to create a container on one of the following manages Kubernetes services: 
[Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service) (AKS), [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) (EKS), [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) (GKE), or [Tencent Kubernetes Engine](https://www.tencentcloud.com/products/tke) (TKE). Palette also supports [data centers](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/clusters/data-center/) and other deployment strategies, but those are beyond the scope of this guide.

## **Step 1**: Create a cluster profile in Palette {#create-a-cluster-in-palette}

Palette uses infrastructure-level [cluster profiles](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/profiles/cluster-profiles/) to help you create and deploy a Kubernetes cluster with your service of choice. Profiles are layers of Helm charts, manifests, and [packs](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/integrations/) provided by Palette to repeatedly deploy clusters to multiple providers and manage them in Palette.

If you already have a cluster profile in Palette, you can skip to [Step 2: Add the ngrok Kubernetes Ingress Controller via Palette Pack](#add-ngrok-kubernetes-controller-palette-pack). If you already a functioning *cluster* managed by Palette, you can skip to [Step 3: TKTK](#).

1. [Log in](ttps://console.spectrocloud.com/) to your Palette account.

1. Click **Profiles** in the navigation, then **Add Cluster Profile**. In the **Basic Information** tab, give your profile a name, like `ngrokker`, and a version. For this guide, leave the **Type** as the default **Full**, then click **Next**.

1. In the **Cloud Type** tab, choose your provider.

1. In the **Profile Layers** tab, click on your base OS pack—in most cases, there will be a single option, like `Container-Optimized OS` or `Linux`. This is where you would add customizations or additional manifests, but you can the settings at their default and click **Next layer**.

  ![Select packs and options](img/select-pack.png)

  Repeat the process for the base Kubernetes, Network, and Storage packs. At the final step, click **Confirm**.

1. Palette now shows you the layers of this new cluster profile. You can also add new Packs, manifests, or Helm charts, but to save you progress for now, click **Next**, then **Finish Configuration**—you'll add a new Pack in the next step.

## **Step 2**: Add the ngrok Kubernetes Ingress Controller via Palette Pack {#add-ngrok-kubernetes-controller-palette-pack}

You've defined the core layers of your future cluster, but there is at least one more layer you can define before you deploy this cluster profile to your Kubernetes provider: the ngrok Kubernetes Ingress Controller. Palette has created a [ready-to-apply pack](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/integrations/ngrok/#prerequisites) to simplify configuration and repeatability across multiple Palette-managed clusters.

1. Palette should have dropped you back into the **Profiles** section, where you can click on your new cluster profile.

1. Click **Add New Pack**, then either search `ngrok`, or scroll down to the **Ingress** section, and click on the **ngrok Kubernetes Ingress Controller** icon.

From here, you have a few options:

### Clean up

### Extend your ngrok Kubernetes Ingress Controller and Palette integration

ngrok can manage multiple routes on a single Edge, allowing you to configure [name-based virtual hosting](https://github.com/ngrok/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/main/docs/user-guide/ingress-to-edge-relationship.md#name-based-virtual-hosting) or [route
modules](https://github.com/ngrok/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/main/docs/user-guide/route-modules.md) to secure multiple apps with a single sign-on experience.

[Custom domains](https://github.com/ngrok/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/main/docs/user-guide/custom-domain.md) and a [circuit breaker](/docs/http/circuit-breaker/) are also good next steps to make your integration production-ready.

Learn more about the ngrok Ingress Controller, or contribute, by checking out the [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/ngrok/kubernetes-ingress-controller) and the [project-specific
documentation](https://github.com/ngrok/kubernetes-ingress-controller/tree/main/docs).
