# Clearbit Webhooks

:::tip TL;DR

To integrate Clearbit webhooks with ngrok:

1. [Launch your local webhook.](#start-your-app) `npm start`
1. [Launch ngrok.](#start-ngrok) `ngrok http 3000`
1. [Configure Clearbit webhooks with your ngrok URL.](#setup-webhook)
1. [Secure your webhook requests with verification.](#security)

:::

This guide covers how to use ngrok to integrate your localhost app with Clearbit by using Webhooks.
Clearbit webhooks can be used to notify an external application whenever specific events occur in your Clearbit account.

By integrating ngrok with Clearbit, you can:

- **Develop and test Clearbit webhooks locally**, eliminating the time in deploying your development code to a public environment and setting it up in HTTPS.
- **Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Clearbit** in real-time via the inspection UI and API.
- **Modify and Replay Clearbit Webhook requests** with a single click and without spending time reproducing events manually in your Clearbit account.
- **Secure your app with Clearbit validation provided by ngrok**. Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## **Step 1**: Start your app {#start-your-app}

For this tutorial, we'll use the [sample NodeJS app available on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install this sample, run the following commands in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

This will get the project installed locally.

Now you can launch the app by running the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs by default on port 3000.

You can validate that the app is up and running by visiting http://localhost:3000. The application logs request headers and body in the terminal and responds with a message in the browser.

## **Step 2**: Launch ngrok {#start-ngrok}

Once your app is running successfully on localhost, let's get it on the internet securely using ngrok!

1. If you're not an ngrok user yet, just [sign up for ngrok for free](https://ngrok.com/signup).

1. [Download the ngrok agent](https://download.ngrok.com).

1. Go to the [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com) and copy your Authtoken. <br />
   **Tip:** The ngrok agent uses the auth token to log into your account when you start a tunnel.
1. Start ngrok by running the following command:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

1. ngrok will display a URL where your localhost application is exposed to the internet (copy this URL for use with Clearbit).

## **Step 3**: Integrate Clearbit {#setup-webhook}

To register a webhook on your Clearbit account follow the instructions below:

1. Access the [Clearbit API Dashboard](https://dashboard.clearbit.com/api) and sign in using your Clearbit account.

1. On the **API Settings** section, enter the URL provided by the ngrok agent to expose your application to the internet in the **Webhook URL** field (i.e. `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).

1. Click **Update account**.

1. Make note of the value of the **Secret API Key** that appears on the [Clearbit API Dashboard](https://dashboard.clearbit.com/api) page.
   **Note**: Usually the secret key value starts with `sk_`.

### Run Webhooks with Clearbit and ngrok

Clearbit sends different request body contents depending on the event that is being triggered.
You can trigger new calls from Clearbit to your application by following the instructions below.

1. Open a terminal window and run the following command to gather information about your account:

   ```
   curl --request GET --url https://person.clearbit.com/v1/people/email/EMAIL_ADDRESS \
   --header 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN'
   ```

   **Note**: Replace the following with values copied on previous steps:

   - EMAIL_ADDRESS: An email address of a user in your Clearbit account organization.
   - TOKEN: The Clearbit secret key you copied before.

   Confirm your localhost app receives a notification and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

## Secure webhook requests {#security}

The ngrok signature webhook verification feature allows ngrok to assert that requests from your Clearbit webhook are the only traffic allowed to make calls to your localhost app.

**Note:** This ngrok feature is limited to 500 validations per month on free ngrok accounts. For unlimited, upgrade to Pro or Enterprise.

This is a quick step to add extra protection to your application.

1. Access the [Clearbit API Dashboard](https://dashboard.clearbit.com/api/) and sign in using your Clearbit account.

1. Copy the value of the **Secret API Key** field that appears on the screen.
   **Note**: Usually the secret key value starts with `sk_`.

1. Create a traffic policy file named `clearbit_policy.yml`, replacing `{your api key}` with the value you copied before:

   ```yaml
   on_http_request:
     - actions:
         - type: verify-webhook
           config:
             provider: clearbit
             secret: "{your api key}"
   ```

1. Restart your ngrok agent by running the command:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file clearbit_policy.yml
   ```

1. Repeat the command to gather information about your account.

Verify that your local application receives the request and logs the information to the terminal.
