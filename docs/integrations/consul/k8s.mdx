import TrafficPolicyGoogleOauth from '../../../examples/k8s/trafficpolicy/example.mdx';

The [ngrok Kubernetes Operator](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator) is our official open-source controller for adding public and secure ingress traffic to your k8s services. It works on any cloud, local, or on-prem Kubernetes cluster to provide ingress to your services no matter the network configuration, as long as it has outbound access to the ngrok service. This allows ngrok to be portable and work seamlessly across any type of infrastructure.

[Consul](https://www.consul.io/) is a secure and resilient service mesh that provides service discovery, configuration, and segmentation functionality. Consul Connect provides service-to-service connection authorization and encryption using mutual TLS, automatically enabling TLS for all Connect services. Consul can be used with Kubernetes to provide a service mesh for your Kubernetes cluster.

Together, Consul provides a robust and secure way for Services within a cluster to communicate, while ngrok can seamlessly and securely provide public ingress to those services. This guide will walk you through setting up a Consul Service Mesh on Kubernetes and then using the ngrok Kubernetes Operator to provide ingress to your services to illustrate how they can work together.

## What you'll need

- A remote or local Kubernetes cluster with Consul installed _OR_ [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) to set up a demo cluster locally.
- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup).
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) and [Helm
  3.0.0+](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) installed on your local
  workstation.
- A reserved domain, which you can get in the ngrok
  [dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains) or with the [ngrok
  API](https://ngrok.com/docs/api/resources/reserved-domains/).
  - You can choose from an ngrok subdomain or bring your own custom branded
    domain, like `https://api.example.com`.
  - We'll refer to this domain as `<NGROK_DOMAIN>`.

## Set up a local Consul Service Mesh on Kubernetes {#set-up-a-consul-service-mesh-on-kubernetes}

For this guide, we'll need access to a remote or local Kubernetes cluster with Consul installed. If you have an existing cluster with Consul set up, you can skip this step and proceed to [Step 2: Install the ngrok Kubernetes Operator](#install-the-ngrok-ingress-controller).

If you don't have one set up, we'll set up a local Minikube cluster and install Consul now.

1. Create a local cluster with minikube

```bash
minikube start --profile dc1 --memory 4096 --kubernetes-version=v1.22.0
```

1. Create a file called `values.yaml` with the following contents:

```yaml
# Contains values that affect multiple components of the chart.
global:
  # The main enabled/disabled setting.
  # If true, servers, clients, Consul DNS and the Consul UI will be enabled.
  enabled: true
  # The prefix used for all resources created in the Helm chart.
  name: consul
  # The name of the data center that the agents should register as.
  data center: dc1
  # Enables TLS across the cluster to verify authenticity of the Consul servers and clients.
  tls:
    enabled: true
  # Enables ACLs across the cluster to secure access to data and APIs.
  acls:
    # If true, automatically manage ACL tokens and policies for all Consul components.
    manageSystemACLs: true
# Configures values that configure the Consul server cluster.
server:
  enabled: true
  # The number of server agents to run. This determines the fault tolerance of the cluster.
  replicas: 1
# Contains values that configure the Consul UI.
ui:
  enabled: true
  # Registers a Kubernetes Service for the Consul UI as a NodePort.
  service:
    type: NodePort
# Configures and installs the automatic Consul Connect sidecar injector.
connectInject:
  enabled: true
```

1. Install the Consul Helm chart

```bash
helm repo add hashicorp https://helm.releases.hashicorp.com

helm install --values values.yaml consul hashicorp/consul --create-namespace --namespace consul --version "1.0.0"
```

:::tip

Depending on your computer, this can take some time for the pods to become healthy. You can watch the status of the pods with `kubectl get pods --namespace consul -w`

:::

1. Verify Consul is installed and all its pods are healthy

```bash
kubectl get pods --namespace consul
NAME                                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS        AGE
consul-connect-injector-6f67d58f8d-2lw6l       1/1     Running   0               17m
consul-server-0                                1/1     Running   0               17m
consul-webhook-cert-manager-5bb6f965c8-pjqms   1/1     Running   0               17m
```

We now have a Kubernetes cluster with a Consul service mesh installed.

## Configure the ngrok Kubernetes Operator {#install-the-ngrok-ingress-controller}

Consul requires a bit of extra configruation to work with ngrok's Operator for
Kubernetes ingress. You'll need to use a pod annotation to enable the Consul
Connect sidecar injector. This will allow us to use Consul Connect to secure the
traffic between the ngrok Kubernetes Operator and our services.

1.  First, create a Kubernetes Service for the ngrok Kubernetes Operator. Consul relies on this to name our services to declare Service Intention `source` and `destination` values. We'll create a Kubernetes Service for the ngrok Kubernetes Operator in the `consul` namespace.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: ngrok-operator
      namespace: consul
    spec:
      ports:
        - name: http
          port: 80
          protocol: TCP
          targetPort: 80
      selector:
        app.kubernetes.io/name: ngrok-operator
    ```

1.  Install the ngrok Kubernetes Operator

    Next, install the ngrok Kubernetes Operator into our cluster. We want the controller pods to be in the Consul service mesh in order to proxy traffic to our other services. We'll use pod annotations to enable the Consul Connect sidecar injector and allow outbound traffic to use the Consul mesh. Consul documents how to set these 2 annotations in the [Configure Operators for Consul on Kubernetes](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/k8s/connect/ingress-controllers) doc.

    ```yaml
    # This annotation is required to enable the Consul Connect sidecar injector
    consul.hashicorp.com/connect-inject: "true"
    # This is the CIDR of your Kubernetes API: `kubectl get svc kubernetes --output jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}'
    consul.hashicorp.com/transparent-proxy-exclude-outbound-cidrs: "10.96.0.1/32"
    ```

    Check out our [Operator installation doc](/docs/k8s/installation/helm/) for details on how to use Helm to install with your ngrok credentials. Once you've done that, you can run the command below to set the appropriate annotations.

    ```bash
    helm install ngrok-operator ngrok/ngrok-operator \
      --reuse-values
      --set-string podAnnotations.consul\\.hashicorp\\.com/connect-inject=true \
    	--set podAnnotations."consul\.hashicorp\.com/transparent-proxy-exclude-outbound-cidrs"="YOUR KUBERNETES API CIDR"
    ```

:::note

- HashiCorp's docs also mention the annotation `consul.hashicorp.com/transparent-proxy-exclude-inbound-ports`. This is not applicable to the ngrok Kubernetes Operator as we create an outbound connection for Ingress rather than exposing ports.
- The `--set-string` flag allows the pod annotation to escape the `.` character in the annotation name while ensuring the value `true` is a boolean and not a string.
- In a production environment, or anywhere you wish to use Infrastructure as Code and source control your Helm configurations, you can set up your credentials following this [guide](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/blob/main/docs/deployment-guide/credentials.md).

:::

## Install a Sample Application {#install-a-sample-application}

Now let's install a sample application to try out our service mesh and Operator combination. We'll use the [HashiCups Demo Application](https://github.com/hashicorp-demoapp) HashiCorp uses for demos and guides such as in their [Getting Started with Consul Service Mesh for Kubernetes](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/tutorials/kubernetes-features/service-mesh-deploy) guide. This application is a simple e-commerce application that allows users to order coffee cups.
The application has a `frontend` and public API services that are also backed by a private API and database. These communicate with each other through the Consul service mesh. This comes with nginx installed as a proxy for the `frontend` and Public API services. We'll replace this with ngrok to provide public access and other features.

:::tip For this demo, everything will be installed in the `consul` namespace.

The ngrok Kubernetes Operator can send traffic to services across different namespaces, but [Consul Service Intentions](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/connect/config-entries/service-intentions) across namespaces [require an enterprise account](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/connect/config-entries/service-intentions#sources-namespace). For now, we'll keep everything in the same namespace.
:::

1. Clone the [HashiCorp Learning Consul repo](https://github.com/hashicorp/learn-consul-kubernetes). This has multiple great example applications for learning about Consul and Kubernetes. We'll use the HashiCups application for this guide.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/learn-consul-kubernetes
```

1. Install the HashiCups sample app in the `consul` namespace. This app consists of multiple Services and Deployments that make a tiered application. We'll install all of them from this folder and then modify things from there.

```bash
kubectl apply -f learn-consul-kubernetes/service-mesh/deploy/hashicups -n consul
```

1. Remove the existing [Service Intentions](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/connect/config-entries/service-intentions) for the `public-api` and `frontend` services and add our own.

Consul has the concept of [Service Intentions](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/connect/config-entries/service-intentions). In short, they are a programmatic way to configure the Consul Service mesh to allow or deny traffic between services.

HashiCups comes with `nginx` installed with intentions to the `frontend` and `public-api` services. We'll remove these and add our own intentions to allow traffic from the ngrok Kubernetes Operator to the `frontend` and `public-api` services.

```bash
kubectl delete serviceintentions public-api -n consul
kubectl delete serviceintentions frontend -n consul
```

1. Create Service Intention from ngrok to HashiCups and the public-api

```yaml
apiVersion: consul.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceIntentions
metadata:
  name: ngrok-consul-frontend
  namespace: consul
spec:
  destination:
    name: frontend
  sources:
    - action: allow
      name: ngrok-operator
```

```yaml
apiVersion: consul.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceIntentions
metadata:
  name: ngrok-consul-api
  namespace: consul
spec:
  sources:
    - name: frontend
      action: allow
    - name: ngrok-operator
      action: allow
  destination:
    name: public-api
```

## Configure Public Ingress for the sample application {#configure-public-ingress-for-the-sample-application}

Now that the ngrok Kubernetes Operator can communicate with the `frontend` service and `public-api` service through the Consul Service Mesh via Service Intentions, we can create an ingress to route traffic to the app. We'll create ingress objects to route traffic to the `frontend` service and the `public-api` service.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress-consul
  namespace: consul
spec:
  ingressClassName: ngrok
  rules:
    - host: <NGROK_DOMAIN>
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: frontend
                port:
                  number: 3000
          - path: /api
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: public-api
                port:
                  number: 8080
```

:::tip This ingress object:

- Uses the `ngrok` ingress class
- The host is the ngrok domain name you selected that is static
- There is a route for `/` that routes to the `frontend` service on port `3000`
- There is a route for `/api` that routes to the `public-api` service on port `8080`

:::

Open your `<NGROK_DOMAIN>` domain in your browser and see the HashiCups application!

## Add OAuth Protection to the App {#add-oauth-protection-to-the-app}

Let's take your ingress needs a little further by assuming you want to add edge security, in the form of Google OAuth,
to the endpoint where your 2048 application is humming along.

With our [Traffic Policy system](/docs/traffic-policy/) and the [`oauth`
action](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/oauth), ngrok manages OAuth protection
entirely at the ngrok cloud service, which means you don't need to add any
additional services to your cluster, or alter routes, to ensure ngrok's edge
authenticates and authorizes all requests before allowing ingress and access to
your endpoint.

To enable the `oauth` action, you'll create a new `NgrokTrafficPolicy` custom
resource and apply it to your entire `Ingress` with an annotation. You can also
apply the policy to just a specific backend or as the default backend for an
`Ingress`—see our doc on using the [Operator with
Ingresses](/docs/k8s/guides/using-ingresses/#using-ngroktrafficpolicy-with-ingress).

1. Edit your existing ingress configuration with the following—note the new `annotations` field and
   the `NgrokTrafficPolicy` CR.

   ```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: ingress-consul
      namespace: consul
   	 annotations:
       k8s.ngrok.com/traffic-policy: oauth
    spec:
      ingressClassName: ngrok
      rules:
        - host: <NGROK_DOMAIN>
          http:
            paths:
              - path: /
                pathType: Prefix
                backend:
                  service:
                    name: frontend
                    port:
                      number: 3000
              - path: /api
                pathType: Prefix
                backend:
                  service:
                   name: public-api
                    port:
                      number: 8080
   ---
   # Traffic Policy configuration for OAuth
   apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
   kind: NgrokTrafficPolicy
   metadata:
     name: oauth
     namespace: default
   spec:
     policy:
   	   on_http_request:
   		   - type: oauth
   			   config:
   			     provider: google
   ```

1. Re-apply your configuration.

1. When you open your demo app again, you'll be asked to log in via Google.
   That's a start, but what if you want to authenticate only yourself or colleagues?

1. You can use [expressions](/docs/traffic-policy/concepts/expressions) and [CEL
   interpolation](/docs/traffic-policy/concepts/cel-interpolation) to filter out
   and reject OAuth logins that don't contain `example.com`. Update the
   `NgrokTrafficPolicy` portion of your manifest after changing `example.com` to
   your domain.

   <TrafficPolicyGoogleOauth withDomain={true} />

1. Check out your deployed HashiCups app once again. If you log in with an email that
   doesn't match your domain, ngrok rejects your request. Authentication... done!

Now only you can order from HashiCups from anywhere!
