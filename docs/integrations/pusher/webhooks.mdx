# Pusher Webhooks

:::tip TL;DR

To integrate Pusher webhooks with ngrok:

1. [Launch your local webhook.](#start-your-app) `npm start`
1. [Launch ngrok.](#start-ngrok) `ngrok http 3000`
1. [Configure Pusher webhooks with your ngrok URL.](#setup-webhook)
1. [Secure your webhook requests with verification.](#security)

:::

This guide covers how to use ngrok to integrate your localhost app with Pusher by using Webhooks.
Pusher webhooks can be used to notify an external application whenever specific events occur in your Pusher channel.

By integrating ngrok with Pusher, you can:

- **Develop and test Pusher webhooks locally**, eliminating the time in deploying your development code to a public environment and setting it up in HTTPS.
- **Inspect and troubleshoot requests from Pusher** in real-time via the inspection UI and API.
- **Modify and Replay Pusher Webhook requests** with a single click and without spending time reproducing events manually in your Pusher account.
- **Secure your app with Pusher validation provided by ngrok**. Invalid requests are blocked by ngrok before reaching your app.

## **Step 1**: Start your app {#start-your-app}

For this tutorial, we'll use the [sample NodeJS app available on GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample).

To install this sample, run the following commands in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample.git
cd ngrok-webhook-nodejs-sample
npm install
```

This will get the project installed locally.

Now you can launch the app by running the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs by default on port 3000.

You can validate that the app is up and running by visiting http://localhost:3000. The application logs request headers and body in the terminal and responds with a message in the browser.

## **Step 2**: Launch ngrok {#start-ngrok}

Once your app is running successfully on localhost, let's get it on the internet securely using ngrok!

1. If you're not an ngrok user yet, just [sign up for ngrok for free](https://ngrok.com/signup).

1. [Download the ngrok agent](https://download.ngrok.com).

1. Go to the [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com) and copy your Authtoken. <br />
   **Tip:** The ngrok agent uses the auth token to log into your account when you start a tunnel.
1. Start ngrok by running the following command:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

1. ngrok will display a URL where your localhost application is exposed to the internet (copy this URL for use with Pusher).

## **Step 3**: Integrate Pusher {#setup-webhook}

To register a webhook on your Pusher channel follow the instructions below:

1. Access the [Pusher dashboard](https://dashboard.pusher.com/), sign in using your Pusher account, and then click your channel name in the **Channels** tile.

   **Tip**: If you don't have a channel, create one with the name `my-channel`.

1. On your channel page, click **Webhooks** on the left menu and then click **Add webhook**.

1. On the **Add new webhook** popup, enter the URL provided by the ngrok agent to expose your application to the internet in the **Webhook URL** field (i.e. `https://1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.ngrok.app`).

1. Click **Client events** under the **Event type** section and then click **Save**.

1. Repeat the previous 3 steps to create webhooks for the other **Event type** values.

### Run Webhooks with Pusher and ngrok {#run-webhook}

Pusher sends different request body contents depending on the event that is being triggered.
You can trigger new calls from Pusher to your application by creating a client event test.

1. On the [Pusher dashboard](https://dashboard.pusher.com/), click **Debug console** on the left menu, expand the **Event creator** section, enter `my-channel` in the **Channel** field, enter `my-event` in the **Event** field, enter some text in the **Data** field, and then click **Send event**.

   Confirm your localhost app receives an event notification and logs both headers and body in the terminal.

Alternatively, you can verify any error occurring during webhook calls in Pusher:

1. On the [Pusher dashboard](https://dashboard.pusher.com/), click **Error Logs** on the left menu, and then click the **Webhook errors** tab.

**Note**: On this page, Pusher only shows messages that couldn't be delivered for any reason.

## Secure webhook requests {#security}

The ngrok signature webhook verification feature allows ngrok to assert that requests from your Pusher webhook are the only traffic allowed to make calls to your localhost app.

**Note:** This ngrok feature is limited to 500 validations per month on free ngrok accounts. For unlimited, upgrade to Pro or Enterprise.

This is a quick step to add extra protection to your application.

1. On the [Pusher dashboard](https://dashboard.pusher.com/), click **App keys** on the left menu, and then copy the value of the **secret** field that appears on the screen.

1. Create a traffic policy file named `pusher_policy.yml`, replacing `{your webhook secret}` with the value you have copied before:

   ```yaml
   on_http_request:
     - actions:
         - type: verify-webhook
           config:
             provider: pusher
             secret: "{your webhook secret}"
   ```

1. Restart your ngrok agent by running the command:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000 --traffic-policy-file pusher_policy.yml
   ```

1. Repeat the steps described in the [Run Webhooks with Pusher and ngrok](#run-webhook) section.

Verify that your local application receives the request and logs information to the terminal.
