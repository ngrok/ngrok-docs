# Microsoft OAuth

## Creating a custom Microsoft OAuth application

Step-by-step instructions below closely follow [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app) to create a new application for ngrok within the Azure portal.

### Register an application

1.  Sign-in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) then select or [create a tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant) for your application.
2.  Search for "Azure Active Directory" and select it.
3.  Select "App registrations" on the left hand navigation.
4.  Select "New registration" at the top.
5.  Enter a name for your application.
6.  ngrok does not support [**single tenant** applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/single-and-multi-tenant-apps). Choose supported account types from:
    - Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant)
    - Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox)
7.  Choose a "Web" redirect URI and enter `https://idp.ngrok.com/oauth2/callback`.
8.  Register your application. The final form should resemble: ![](/img/howto/oauth/1-microsoft-create_app.png)

### Configure your application

1.  When viewing your application, choose "Overview" on the left hand navigation.
2.  Store the "Application (client) ID" in the top information section for later. ![](/img/howto/oauth/2-microsoft-app_overview.png)
3.  Select "API permissions" on the left hand navigation.
4.  Add additional scopes that your application requires and store them for later.
    - Scopes which require an application review by Microsoft are unsupported.
    - Scopes that [require admin consent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent#admin-restricted-permissions) prevent tenants' users from authorizing until consent is granted.
5.  Ensure `User.Read` or a more permissive scope (e.g. `User.Read.All`) is configured for ngrok. Example minimal configuration: ![](/img/howto/oauth/3-microsoft-api_permissions.png)
6.  Choose "Certificates and Secrets" on the left hand navigation.
7.  Select "New Client Secret" at the bottom, name the secret, set an expiration, and hit create.
8.  Creation is asynchronous. When complete, save the secret from the "Value" column (blurred below) for later: ![](/img/howto/oauth/4-microsoft-client_secret.png)

### Update your endpoint configuration

1.  Return to the ngrok dashboard and create or edit an OAuth endpoint configuration module.
2.  Choose to use your own application with Microsoft as the provider.
3.  Include the scopes, client ID, and client secret for your application.
