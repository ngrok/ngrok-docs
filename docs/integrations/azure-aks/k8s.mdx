title: Ingress to Kubernetes apps deployed on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
description: Learn how to deploy a new Kubernetes cluster and demo app via AKS, then add ingress to applications with ngrok's Kubernetes Operator.
---

In this guide, you'll launch a new cluster with [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service) and a demo app. You'll then add the ngrok Kubernetes Operator to route public traffic directly to your demo app through an encrypted, feature-rich tunnel for a complete proof of concept.

In the end, you'll have learned enough to deploy your next production-ready Kubernetes app with AKS, with the ngrok Kubernetes Operator giving you access to additional features, like observability and resiliency, with no extra configuration complexity.

Here is what you'll be building with:

- The [ngrok Kubernetes Operator](https://ngrok.com/blog-post/ngrok-k8s): ngrok's official controller for adding secure public ingress and middleware execution to your Kubernetes apps with ngrok's cloud service. With ngrok, you can manage and secure traffic to your apps at every stage of the development lifecycle while also benefitting from simpler configurations, security, and edge acceleration.
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS): A managed Kubernetes environment from Microsoft. AKS simplifies the deployment, health monitoring, and maintenance of cloud native applications, whether you deploy them in Azure, in on-premises data centers, or at the edge. With [40 regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=kubernetes-service), you should be able to deploy a cluster close to your customers.

## What you'll need

- An [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/pay-as-you-go) with permissions to create new Kubernetes clusters.
- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup).
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) and [Helm
  3.0.0+](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) installed on your local
  workstation.
- The [ngrok Kubernetes Operator](/docs/k8s/installation/install/) installed on
  your cluster.
- A reserved domain, which you can get in the ngrok
  [dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains) or with the [ngrok
  API](https://ngrok.com/docs/api/resources/reserved-domains/).
  - You can choose from an ngrok subdomain or bring your own custom branded
    domain, like `https://api.example.com`.
  - We'll refer to this domain as `<NGROK_DOMAIN>`.

## Create your cluster in AKS {#create-your-cluster-in-AKS}

Start by creating a new managed Kubernetes cluster in AKS. If you already have one, you can skip to [Step 2: Install the ngrok Kubernetes Operator](#install-the-ngrok-kubernetes-ingress-controller).

1. Go to the [Kubernetes services](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.ContainerService%2FmanagedClusters) section in your Azure console and click **Create**&rarr;**Create a Kubernetes cluster**.

1. Configure your new cluster with the wizard. The default options are generally safe bets, but there are a few you might want to look at depending on your requirements and budget:

   - Cluster present configuration: You can choose a production-ready deployment, a dev/test deployment, and others.
   - Region: The data center where AKS will deploy your cluster—pick a region geographically close to your primary customers and/or your organization.
   - AKS pricing tier: The **Free** tier works great with less than 10 nodes, and you can always upgrade to the production tier after deployment.

1. Click **Review + create** and wait for Azure to validate your configuration. If you see a **Validation failed.** warning, check out the errors—they're likely related to [quota limits](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quotas/regional-quota-requests). When it's ready, click **Create**. Grab a cup of coffee—deployment will take a while.

1. When AKS completes the deployment, click **Go to deployment**, then **Connect**, which will show you options for connecting to your new cluster with kubectl. Follow the instructions to use the Cloud shell or Azure CLI, then double-check AKS has successfully deployed your cluster's underlying services:

   ```bash
   kubectl get deployments --all-namespaces=true
   NAMESPACE         NAME                      READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
   calico-system     calico-kube-controllers   1/1     1            1           5m
   calico-system     calico-typha              1/1     1            1           5m
   kube-system       ama-metrics               1/1     1            1           5m
   kube-system       ama-metrics-ksm           1/1     1            1           5m
   kube-system       coredns                   2/2     2            2           5m
   kube-system       coredns-autoscaler        1/1     1            1           5m
   kube-system       konnectivity-agent        2/2     2            2           5m
   kube-system       metrics-server            2/2     2            2           5m
   tigera-operator   tigera-operator           1/1     1            1           5m
   ```

## Deploy a demo microservices app {#deploy-a-demo-microservices-app}

To showcase how this integration works, you'll deploy the [AKS Store](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-voting-app-redis) app, which uses a microservices architecture to connect frontend UI to API-like services, passing data to RabbitMQ and MongoDB in the backend. To showcase the features of AKS, you'll deploy this demo app directly in the Azure Portal.

       app: store-front
     type: LoadBalancer
   ```

1. Click **Add** to deploy the demo app. To double-check services deployed successfully, click on **Workloads** in the Azure Portal and look for `store-front`, `rabbitmq`, `product-service`, and `order-service` in the `default` namespace. If you prefer the CLI, you can run `kubectl get pods` for the same information.

## Add ngrok's Kubernetes ingress to your demo app {#add-ngrok-based-ingress-to-your-demo-app}

Next, you'll configure and deploy the [ngrok Kubernetes Operator](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator) to expose your demo app to the public internet through the ngrok cloud service.

1. In the Azure Portal, click **Create&rarr;Apply a YAML**.

1. Copy and paste the YAML below into the editor. This manifest defines how the ngrok Kubernetes Operator should route traffic arriving on `NGROK_DOMAIN` to the `store-front` service on port `80`, which you deployed in the previous step.

   :::tip

   Make sure you edit line `9` of the YAML below, which contains the `NGROK_DOMAIN` variable, with the ngrok subdomain you created in the second step.

   :::

   ```yaml showLineNumbers
   apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: Ingress
   metadata:
     name: store-ingress
   spec:
     ingressClassName: ngrok
     rules:
       - host: NGROK_DOMAIN
         http:
           paths:
             - path: /
               pathType: Prefix
               backend:
                 service:
                   name: store-front
                   port:
                     number: 80
   ```

1. Click **Add** to deploy the ingress configuration.

   You can check on the status of the ingress deployment in the Azure Portal at **Services and ingresses**&rarr;**Ingresses**. You should see the `store-ingress` name and your ngrok subdomain. If you need to edit your ingress configuration in the future, click on the ingress item and then the **YAML** tab.

1. Navigate to your ngrok subdomain, e.g. `https://NGROK_DOMAIN.ngrok.app`, in your browser to see the demo app in action. Behind the scenes, ngrok's cloud service routed your request into the ngrok Kubernetes Operator, which then passed it to the `store-front` service.

   ![The AKS Store demo app accessible from the public internet](img/store-front.png)

## Add OAuth authentication to your demo app {#add-oauth-authentication-to-your-demo-app}

Now that your demo app is publicly accessible through the ngrok cloud service, you can quickly layer on [additional capabilities](/universal-gateway/http/), like authentication, without configuring and deploying complex infrastructure. Let's see how that works for restricting access to individual Google accounts or any Google account under a specific domain name.

With our [Traffic Policy system](/docs/traffic-policy/) and the [`oauth`
action](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/oauth), ngrok manages OAuth protection
entirely at the ngrok cloud service, which means you don't need to add any
additional services to your cluster, or alter routes, to ensure ngrok's edge
authenticates and authorizes all requests before allowing ingress and access to
your endpoint.

To enable the `oauth` action, you'll create a new `NgrokTrafficPolicy` custom
resource and apply it to your entire `Ingress` with an annotation. You can also
apply the policy to just a specific backend or as the default backend for an
`Ingress`—see our doc on using the [Operator with
Ingresses](/docs/k8s/guides/using-ingresses/#using-ngroktrafficpolicy-with-ingress).

1. Edit your existing ingress YAML with the following. Note the new `annotations` field and
   the `NgrokTrafficPolicy` CR.

   ```yaml
    ...

   # Configuration for ngrok's Kubernetes Operator
   apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: Ingress
   metadata:
     name: game-2048-ingress
     namespace: default
     annotations:

   spec:
     ingressClassName: ngrok
     rules:
       - host: <NGROK_DOMAIN>
         http:
           paths:
             - path: /
               pathType: Prefix
               backend:
                 service:
                   name: game-2048
                   port:
                     number: 80
   ---
   # Traffic Policy configuration for OAuth
   apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
   kind: NgrokTrafficPolicy
   metadata:
     name: oauth
     namespace: default
   spec:
     policy:
   	   on_http_request:
   		   - type: oauth
   			   config:
   			     provider: google
   ```

1. When you open your demo app again, you'll be asked to log in via Google.
   That's a start, but what if you want to authenticate only yourself or colleagues?

1. You can use [expressions](/docs/traffic-policy/concepts/expressions) and [CEL
   interpolation](/docs/traffic-policy/concepts/cel-interpolation) to filter out
   and reject OAuth logins that don't contain `example.com`. Update the
   `NgrokTrafficPolicy` portion of your manifest after changing `example.com` to
   your domain.

   ```yaml
    # Traffic Policy configuration for OAuth
    apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
    kind: NgrokTrafficPolicy
    metadata:
      name: oauth
      namespace: default
    spec:
      policy:
        on_http_request:
          - type: oauth
            config:
              provider: google
          - expressions:
              - "!actions.ngrok.oauth.identity.email.endsWith('example.com')"
            actions:
              - type: custom-response
                config:
                  body: Hey, no auth for you ${actions.ngrok.oauth.identity.name}!
                  status_code: 400
   ```

1. Check out your deployed app once again. If you log in with an email that
   doesn't match your domain, ngrok rejects your request. Authentication... done!

## What's next?

You've now used the open source ngrok Kubernetes Operator to add public ingress to a demo app on a cluster managed in AKS without having to worry about complex Kubernetes networking configurations. Because ngrok abstracts ingress and middleware execution to its cloud service, you can follow a similar process to route public traffic to your next production-ready app.

For next steps, explore our [Kubernetes docs](/docs/k8s/) for more details on
how the Operator works, different ways you can integrate ngrok with an existing
production cluster, or use more advanced features like
[bindings](docs/k8s/guides/bindings/) or [endpoint
pooling](/docs/k8s/guides/pooling/).
