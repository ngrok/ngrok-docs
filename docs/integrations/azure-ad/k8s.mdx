The [ngrok Ingress Controller for Kubernetes](https://ngrok.com/blog-post/ngrok-k8s) is the official controller for adding secure public ingress and middleware execution to your Kubernetes applications with ngrok's Cloud Edge. With ngrok, you can manage and secure traffic to your applications at every stage of the development lifecycle while also benefitting from simpler configurations, security, and edge acceleration.

Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AD)—now known as [Micosoft Entra ID](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id) (see the tip below)—is an identity and access management platform that helps administrators and DevOps engineers safeguard their organization's multicloud environment with strong authentication and unified identity management, whether they are running in the Azure cloud or on-premises.

:::note

In October 2023, Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AD) was [renamed Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/new-name) to "communicate the multicloud, multiplatform functionality" and "alleviate confusion with Windows Server Active Directory." This name change changes nothing about the product or its capabilities. We have used **Azure AD** up to this point due to the recency of the change, but will use **Entra ID** for the remainder.
