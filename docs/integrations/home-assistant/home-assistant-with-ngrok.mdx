# Home Assistant with ngrok

:::tip TL;DR

To put your Home Assistant instance online with ngrok:

1. Start Home Assistant locally in a Docker container
1. Add ngrok to the Docker container
1. Allow trusted proxies in Home Assistant

:::

This guide covers how to set up Home Assistant with ngrok. This combination lets you access your Home Assistant dashboard over the public internet.

Prerequisites:

- Docker Desktop
- Docker Compose
- [ngrok](https://download.ngrok.com) installed on your machine
- Basic familiarity with the command line

Tip: This guide walks through setting up Home Assistant in a Docker container from scratch, but the same principles apply if you already have a Home Assistant instance set up, or if you set it up using one of their other [installation methods](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/).

## **Step 1**: Initial setup

1. Create a directory called `home-assistant`

1. Inside the `home-assistant` directory:

- create your Docker Compose file called `compose.yaml`
- create a directory called `config`

## **Step 2**: Run Home Assistant in a Docker container

1. Update `compose.yaml`:

```yaml
services:
  homeassistant:
    image: "ghcr.io/home-assistant/home-assistant:stable"
    volumes:
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
      - /run/dbus:/run/dbus:ro
      # the first part of this path will be the location of
      # the `/home-assistant/config` directories you created in the last step
      - /Desktop/home-assistant/config:/config
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 8123:8123
    privileged: true
```

1. In your terminal, start a Docker container with this compose.yaml file:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

1. Visit localhost:8123 in your browser. You should see your Home Assistant login page:
   ![Home Assistant on localhost](/img/integrations/ngrok_test_ha_locally.png)

## **Step 3**: Add ngrok

1. Add ngrok to your `compose.yaml` under the services section:

```yaml
services:
  ...
  ngrok:
    image: ngrok/ngrok:latest
    command:
      - "http"
      - "http://host.docker.internal:8123"
    ports:
      # you can choose different ports here if you want
      - 4041:4041
    environment:
      # find this at https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken
      NGROK_AUTHTOKEN: YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
```

1. In your terminal, restart your Docker container with this compose.yaml file:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

1. Visit your [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/endpoints) to see the endpoint URL:
   ![ngrok Endpoints](/img/integrations/ngrok_endpoint.png)

1. If you visit the ngrok URL, you'll get a 4xx response:
   ![ngrok Endpoints](/img/integrations/ngrok_bad_request.png)

and an error log line your Docker Desktop logs for the Home Assistant container:

```
ERROR (MainThread) [homeassistant.components.http.forwarded] A request from a reverse proxy was received from 192.168.65.1, but your HTTP integration is not set-up for reverse proxies
```

That's because we still have to update the Home Assistant configuration to allow trusted proxies.

## **Step 3**: Allow trusted proxies in Home Assistant

1. In your `/home-assistant/config` directory, look for the file called `configuration.yaml`. By default, it should already have these settings:

```yaml
# Loads default set of integrations. Do not remove.
default_config:

# Load frontend themes from the themes folder
frontend:
  themes: !include_dir_merge_named themes

automation: !include automations.yaml
script: !include scripts.yaml
scene: !include scenes.yaml
```

Add this new section to the bottom:

```yaml
http:
  use_x_forwarded_for: true
  trusted_proxies:
    # this IP may be different on your network; grab the IP from the error message
    # in your logs
    - 192.168.65.1
    - 127.0.0.1
    - ::1
```

1. Restart the Docker container so the updated Home Assistant configuration can take effect.

1. Visit your ngrok endpoint URL and see your Home Assistant instance online!
