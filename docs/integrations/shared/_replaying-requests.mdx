# Replaying requests

Test your webhook handling code without triggering new events from your service using the Traffic Inspector's replay feature:

1. Send a test webhook from your service to generate traffic in your Traffic Inspector.

1. Select the request you want to replay in the traffic inspector.

1. Choose your replay option:

   - Click **Replay** to send the exact same request again
   - Select **Replay with modifications** to edit the request before sending

1. Modify the request (optional): Edit any part of the original request, such as changing field values in the request body.

1. Send the request by clicking **Replay**.

Your local application will receive the replayed request and log the data to the terminal.
