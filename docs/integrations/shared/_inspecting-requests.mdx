### Inspecting requests

ngrok's [Traffic Inspector](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/traffic-inspector) captures all requests made through your ngrok endpoint to your localhost app.
Click on any request to view detailed information about both the request and response.

:::info
By default, accounts only collect traffic metadata to avoid exposing secrets.
You must enable full capture in the Observability section of [your account settings](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/settings) to capture complete request and response data.
:::

Use the traffic inspector to:

- Validate webhook payloads and response data
- Debug request headers, methods, and status codes
- Troubleshoot integration issues without adding logging to your app
