The [ngrok Kubernetes Operator](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator) is our official open-source controller for adding public and secure ingress traffic to your k8s services. It works out of the box with Google Kubernetes Engine cluster to provide ingress to your services no matter the network configuration, as long as it has outbound access to the ngrok service. This allows ngrok to be portable and work seamlessly across any type of infrastructure.

## What you'll need

- A [GKE cluster](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/deploy-app-cluster)
- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup).
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) and [Helm
  3.0.0+](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) installed on your local
  workstation.
- The [ngrok Kubernetes Operator](/docs/k8s/) installed on
  your cluster.
- A domain: This can be your free dev domain, or if you're on a paid plan, one that you choose [in the ngrok
  dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains) or with the [ngrok
  API](/docs/api/resources/reserved-domains/#create-reserved-domain). Pay-as-you-go plans allow you to bring your own [custom branded
  domain](/docs/universal-gateway/custom-domains), like
  `https://api.example.com`.
  - We'll refer to this domain as `$YOUR_DOMAIN`.

## Ensure `kubectl` can speak with your cluster {#prereqs}

With a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster, authentication for `kubectl` happens with a credential helper. So in-order to deploy the ngrok Kubernetes Operator to your cluster, you'll need to ensure that you can use the `gcloud` CLI and that the credential helper is available.

Let's ensure that you have the `gcloud` CLI installed and configured with your Google Cloud credentials. You can confirm this works and you're authenticated correctly by running the following command:

```bash
gcloud auth list
```

If you see your correct Google account listed, you should be all set. If not, you can run `gcloud auth login` to authenticate with your Google account.

Next, we'll ensure that the credential helper is available. Run the following command to confirm that the credential helper is available:

```bash
gcloud components install gke-gcloud-auth-plugin
```

Finally, we can add the cluster to our KUBECONFIG:

```bash
gcloud container clusters get-credentials --region <cluster-region> --project <cluster-project> <cluster-name>
```

## Install the ngrok Kubernetes Operator {#install-the-ngrok-ingress-controller}

Now we can install the ngrok Kubernetes Operator to provide ingress to our services.

Check out our [Operator installation doc](/docs/getting-started/kubernetes/ingress/) for
details on how to use Helm to install with your ngrok credentials.

## Install a Sample Application {#install-a-sample-application}

Create a manifest file (for example `ngrok-manifest.yaml`) with the following contents. You will need to replace the `$NGROK_DOMAIN` on line 45 with your own custom value. This is the URL you will use to access your service from anywhere. If you're on a free account, it must be on your [dev domain](/universal-gateway/domains/#dev-domains). For paid accounts, you can use a custom domain or a subdomain of `ngrok.app` or `ngrok.dev` (for example, `username-loves-ingress.ngrok.app` or `k8s.example.com`).

:::tip Notes:

- Lines 1-34: Create the 2048 app service and deployment
- Lines 35-54 (highlighted): Create the ngrok Kubernetes Operator. Line 45 determines the ingress URL for public requests.

:::

<TwentyFourtyEight deployment={true} service={true} ingress={true} />

1. Apply the manifest file to your k8s cluster.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f ngrok-manifest.yaml
   ```

   **Note:** If you get an error when applying the manifest, double check that you've updated the `$NGROK_DOMAIN` value and try again.

1. Access your ingress URL using the subdomain you chose in the manifest file above (i.e. `https://my-awesome-k8s-cluster.ngrok.app`) to confirm the 2048 app is accessible from the internet.

## Add authentication to your app {#add-edge-security}

With our [Traffic Policy system](/docs/traffic-policy/) and the [`oauth`
action](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/oauth), ngrok manages OAuth protection
entirely at the ngrok cloud service, which means you don't need to add any
additional services to your cluster, or alter routes, to ensure ngrok's edge
authenticates and authorizes all requests before allowing ingress and access to
your endpoint.

To enable the `oauth` action, you'll create a new `NgrokTrafficPolicy` custom
resource and apply it to your entire `Ingress` with an annotation. You can also
apply the policy to just a specific backend or as the default backend for an
`Ingress`â€”see our doc on using the [Operator with
Ingresses](/docs/k8s/guides/using-ingresses/#using-ngroktrafficpolicy-with-ingress).

1. Edit your existing `ngrok-manifest.yaml` manifest with the following, leaving the
   `Service` and `Deployment` as they were. Note the new `annotations` field and
   the `NgrokTrafficPolicy` CR.

    <TwentyFourtyEight withOauth={true} ingress={true} trafficPolicy={true} />

1. Re-apply your `ngrok-manifest.yaml` configuration.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f ngrok-manifest.yaml
   ```

1. When you open your demo app again, you'll be asked to log in via Google.
   That's a start, but what if you want to authenticate only yourself or colleagues?

1. You can use [expressions](/docs/traffic-policy/concepts/expressions) and [CEL
   interpolation](/docs/traffic-policy/concepts/cel-interpolation) to filter out
   and reject OAuth logins that don't contain `example.com`. Update the
   `NgrokTrafficPolicy` portion of your manifest after changing `example.com` to
   your domain.

   <TrafficPolicyGoogleOauth withDomain={true} />

1. Check out your deployed 2048 app once again. If you log in with an email that
   doesn't match your domain, ngrok rejects your request. Authentication... done!
