The [ngrok Kubernetes Operator](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator) is our official open-source controller for adding public and secure ingress traffic to your k8s services. It works out of the box with n AWS EKS Kubernetes cluster to provide ingress to your services no matter the network configuration, as long as it has outbound access to the ngrok service. This allows ngrok to be portable and work seamlessly across any type of infrastructure.

## What you'll need

- An [AWS EKS cluster](https://eksctl.io/usage/creating-and-managing-clusters/).
- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup).
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) and [Helm
  3.0.0+](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) installed on your local
  workstation.
- The [ngrok Kubernetes Operator](/docs/k8s/installation/install/) installed on
  your cluster.
- A reserved domain, which you can get in the ngrok
  [dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains) or with the [ngrok
  API](https://ngrok.com/docs/api/resources/reserved-domains/).
  - You can choose from an ngrok subdomain or bring your own custom branded
    domain, like `https://api.example.com`.
  - We'll refer to this domain as `<NGROK_DOMAIN>`.

## Ensure `kubectl` can speak with your cluster {#prereqs}

With an AWS EKS cluster, authentication for `kubectl` happens with a credential helper. So in-order to deploy the ngrok Kubernetes Operator to your cluster, you'll need to ensure that you can use the `aws` CLI and that the credential helper is available.

Recent versions of `eksctl` rely on the `aws eks get-token` command, which requires the `aws` CLI to be at-least version `1.16.156`.

Let's ensure that you have the `aws` CLI installed and configured with your AWS credentials. You can confirm this works and you're authenticated correctly by running the following command:

```shell
aws --version
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

If this works, we can now request a kubeconfig:

```shell
# This will merge the cluster into your $KUBECONFIG or ~/.kube/config
aws eks update-kubeconfig --region <region-code> --name <my-cluster>

# To keep your kubeconfig isolated, use:
aws eks update-kubeconfig --kubeconfig kubeconfig --region <region-code> --name <my-cluster>
export KUBECONFIG=$(pwd)/kubeconfig
```

## Install a sample application and Kubernetes ingress {#install-a-sample-application}

Create a manifest file (for example `ngrok-manifest.yaml`) with the following contents. You will need to replace the `NGROK_DOMAIN` on line 45 with your own custom value. This is the URL you will use to access your service from anywhere. If you're on a free account, it must be on a static subdomain which you can claim by logging into your account and following the instructions on the claim static subdomain banner. For paid accounts, you can use a custom domain or a subdomain of `ngrok.app` or `ngrok.dev` (for example, `username-loves-ingress.ngrok.app` or `k8s.example.com`).

```yaml showLineNumbers
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: game-2048
spec:
  ports:
    - name: http
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  selector:
    app: game-2048
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: game-2048
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: game-2048
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: game-2048
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: backend
          image: alexwhen/docker-2048
          ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: 80
---
# Configuration for ngrok's Kubernetes Operator
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: game-2048-ingress
  namespace: default
spec:
  ingressClassName: ngrok
  rules:
    - host: <NGROK_DOMAIN>
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: game-2048
                port:
                  number: 80
```

1. Apply the manifest file to your k8s cluster.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f ngrok-manifest.yaml
   ```

   **Note:** If you get an error when applying the manifest, double check that you've updated the `NGROK_DOMAIN` value and try again.

1. Access your ingress URL using the subdomain you chose in the manifest file above (i.e. `https://my-awesome-k8s-cluster.ngrok.app`) to confirm the 2048 app is accessible from the internet.

## Add edge security to your app {#add-edge-security}

With our [Traffic Policy system](/docs/traffic-policy/) and the [`oauth`
action](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/oauth), ngrok manages OAuth protection
entirely at the cloud edge. ngrok's edge authenticates and authorizes all
requests before allowing ingress and access to your endpoint, meaning you don't
need to add any additional services to your cluster, or alter any routes.

To enable the `oauth` action, you'll create a new `NgrokTrafficPolicy` custom
resource and apply it to your entire `Ingress` with an annotation. You can also
apply the policy to just a specific backend or as the default backend for an
`Ingress`â€”see our doc on using the [Operator with
Ingresses](/docs/k8s/guides/using-ingresses/#using-ngroktrafficpolicy-with-ingress).

1. Edit your existing `2048.yaml` manifest with the following, leaving the
   `Service` and `Deployment` as they were. Note the new `annotations` field and
   the `NgrokTrafficPolicy` CR.

   ```yaml
    ...
   ---
   # Configuration for ngrok's Kubernetes Operator
   apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: Ingress
   metadata:
     name: game-2048-ingress
     namespace: default
     annotations:
       k8s.ngrok.com/traffic-policy: oauth
   spec:
     ingressClassName: ngrok
     rules:
       - host: <NGROK_DOMAIN>
         http:
           paths:
             - path: /
               pathType: Prefix
               backend:
                 service:
                   name: game-2048
                   port:
                     number: 80
   ---
   # Traffic Policy configuration for OAuth
   apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
   kind: NgrokTrafficPolicy
   metadata:
     name: oauth
     namespace: default
   spec:
     policy:
   	   on_http_request:
   		   - type: oauth
   			   config:
   			     provider: google
   ```

1. Re-apply your `2048.yaml` configuration.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f 2048.yaml
   ```

1. When you open your demo app again, you'll be asked to log in via Google.
   That's a start, but what if you want to authenticate only yourself or colleagues?

1. You can use [expressions](/docs/traffic-policy/concepts/expressions) and [CEL
   interpolation](/docs/traffic-policy/concepts/cel-interpolation) to filter out
   and reject OAuth logins that don't contain `example.com`. Update the
   `NgrokTrafficPolicy` portion of your manifest after changing `example.com` to
   your domain.

   ```yaml
   ---
   # Traffic Policy configuration for OAuth
   apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
   kind: NgrokTrafficPolicy
   metadata:
     name: oauth
     namespace: default
   spec:
     policy:
   	   on_http_request:
   		   - type: oauth
   			   config:
   			     provider: google
   			 - expressions:
   			     - "!actions.ngrok.oauth.identity.email.endsWith('example.com')"
           actions:
             - type: custom-response
               config:
                 content: Hey, no auth for you ${actions.ngrok.oauth.identity.name}!
                 status_code: 400
   ```

1. Check out your deployed 2048 app once again. If you log in with an email that
   doesn't match your domain, ngrok rejects your request. Authentication... done!
