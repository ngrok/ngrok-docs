# Bot Users

## Overview

Bot Users are similar to [Users](/iam/#users) but they are intended for
automated systems that programmatically interact with your ngrok accounts
either by starting ngrok Agents or making requests to the API. Other platforms
sometimes call this concept a _Service Account_.

Bot Users own a set of credentials (Authtokens, API Keys and SSH Keys) that
they use to authenticate with ngrok.

You can see and manage your bot users in the [ngrok
Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/users/bots).

### When should I use a Bot User? {#bot-user-use-cases}

You should use Bot Users whenever an automated process is using with your ngrok
account. Bot Users are the best choice in these circumstances because they
guarantee that your agents or programs continue working after the user who set
them up leaves your account. When a user leaves an account, all of their
credentials are revoked; setting up Bot Users for those services helps you
avoid downtime and impact to your production services.

### Differences from Users

Bot Users function exactly like Users with a few exceptions:

- Bot Users may not log into the Dashboard
- Bot Users are not subject to RBAC
- Bot Users may not be a member of more than one Account
- If you are subscribed to a seat-based pricing plan, Bot Users are not counted
  when computing how many seats you are charged for

### Role Based Access Control

Bot Users operate with full developer permissions and have no other
permissions. You cannot currently used RBAC to restrict Bot User privileges.

### Event Logs

When a Bot User takes actions against your ngrok account, it will be recorded
as the [Principal](/obs/#principal-object) in the logged Event. This helps you
isolate what an automated service is doing with your ngrok account, especially
when there are multiple such services.

### Pricing

Bot Users are available to all ngrok users at no additional charge. You only
incur costs if usage or resources provisioned by the Bot User incur a cost.
